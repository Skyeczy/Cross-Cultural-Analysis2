Game Challenge between Curry's how to Grandmaster he said Dolan the alphago supercomputer has concluded with machined eating human for games to one doesn't just leave us with a winner and a loser but rather its left us with unlimited possibilities in terms of human Ingenuity and the future of artificial intelligence Man versus the machine or man with the machine used to be sure tonight with Ichiban
after 5 hours and 280 moved Isabelle resigned
the 5-day challenge between Korean Grandmaster you said all and alphago came to an end on Tuesday with alphago waiting for the one
people will continue to debate the competitors move and how each one but the meaning of artificial intelligence and human intelligence has left us with more to think about
this tournament is the first competition between an AI system and a top-level professional player which is why I gained Global attention even before it started
I believe this is the first step towards battles between Mankind and AI it's going to write a new history for both ba-doop and artificial intelligence it over who or what would emerge as a champ but when the supercomputer took the first game there was still shop
many people thought alphago had the advantage but half the people who know how do I thought you said there was going to win so they were very surprised at the outcome now that it has their start to things that AI has outsmarted humans in public like it did with the game of this shogi or Japanese chess
alphago continue to rack up win in Marda turning point in how Koreans view artificial intelligence at first I thought I was just looking the first game but as the tournament progressed I was surprised to see what it was actually capable of
it's surprising to see that artificial intelligence can compete with human intelligence and at the same time it's also a little scary artificial intelligence could sound like something in a science fiction movie but in reality it's everywhere in our daily life
Google Translate for instance is an AI program that uses an algorithm that employs a combination of neural networks and deep machine learning to recognize letters and words for the appropriate meeting and do a translation
driverless cars are perhaps one of the most controversial applications of artificial intelligence that's in development and on the way to commercialization
but all of these advancements have raced a question of how much should humans rely on AI as well as a fear that a I could eventually take over Humanity
what obstacle to commercialization of autonomous cars is a concerning possibility of accidents and whether a human safety is at risk
the AI devices developed so far are weak meaning it does not have Consciousness sentience and mine so while it may be exact it is calculations situations that go beyond its database is an algorithm will shake it system and that's exactly what happened when alphago lost so you said all in the fourth match where the computer got flustered by one of these moves and then it made a fatal me see the latest paddle match many were amused is how smart artificial intelligence has become that doesn't mean we should worship it in the end humans created these machines and we didn't but using as a tool
experts added that instead we should focus on creating a set of ethical regulations to make sure that we're ready to fully use the resources when they become available because Indian it all the more for Humanity. We do not know who will win but we know that at the end humans will be smarter at the world be a much better place
