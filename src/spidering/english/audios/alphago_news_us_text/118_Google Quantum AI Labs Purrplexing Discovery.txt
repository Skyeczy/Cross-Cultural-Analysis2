hello and this is not love 20% project where we go behind the scenes of Google learning about all the stuff are curious about and today we're going to do something a little bit different and we're actually bringing you a breaking news story out of Google's Quantum AI lab last week while working on an optimization problem searching for dark matter in the universe researchers discovered some really unusual results at first I thought I was the only parameters but it turns out that I'm closer examination it was actually a small ball of yarn I set up an ion trap to attempt to unravel it and this ball of yarn was unspooling unraveling faster and faster and faster down a quantum wormhole into what we believe is a heavy density Quantum space consisting mostly of feline matter or a summer calling it a parallel universe of cats
best Discovery is significant in many ways first of all it shows that cats are not just important to the universe that we live in but to other universes as well to researchers now hypothesize that this could mean there other parallel universes of additional furry animals like dogs and otters flops and 3 probably the most significant is the timing of this discovery which fell on caturday
when the corner of my eye lab started no one was really sure exactly what the research would lead to we imagine better algorithms brass faster Computing this entire time we've been living Our Lives just adjacent to us as a parallel universe where an infinite amount of cats are living out an infinite amount of possibilities some of which may dovetail with our own lives there could be a world where cats walk upside down where cats fly and where cats are just very very good at music not sure after calling it yarn of universe that unlocked beautiful Enigma or we hope to one day visit Miss Universe and visit with the Google Quantum AI lab but for now thanks for watching and catch you later
after a while we did find through different mathematical modeling and ion sensor detection that there does seem to be a Google Quantum artificial intelligence lab in that Universe put staffed only by cats and they all wear the same clothes as us and they have the same jobs as us the only difference is that all of their last names of a cat
