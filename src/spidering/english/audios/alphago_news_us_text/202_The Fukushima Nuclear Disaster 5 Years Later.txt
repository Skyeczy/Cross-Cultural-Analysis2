the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan 5 years ago killed 16000 people and caused a meltdown at the Fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant releasing massive amounts of radiation and resulting in the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl tens of thousands of people evacuated their homes and most of them haven't been able to return cleaning up the disaster may take up to 40 years the plant contaminates 300 to 400 tons of water everyday there are a thousand tanks at the plant holding more than 700,000 tons of contaminated water that's equivalent to almost 300 olympic size swimming pools and there's no clean plan on how to store the water safely the first of 7 towns that were entirely evacuated finally reopened in September 2015 but less than 2% of residents return that month the others were afraid of lingering radiation or had moved on with their lives
