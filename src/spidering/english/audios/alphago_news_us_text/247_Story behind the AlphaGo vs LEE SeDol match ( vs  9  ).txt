hello you too I am Cy and here is an interesting video about fight of the century human versus Ai and artificial intelligence it's okay even if you don't know how to play Go please enjoy watching it
on March 9th why the whole nation is watching biocentury has begun that is going to match between artificial intelligence and humid in 1997 artificial intelligence known as deep blue the fitted the greatest chess player Gary Castro people claim that trash has a limited move to play so that way I could easily calculate number of cases and Conquer check however having a match in go as different story go has 10 ^ 360 possible move which mosquito has more number of cases than hydrogen atoms face because I'm badass / did not expect an AI program for bit of human professional for at least you take a until alphago the computer program developed by Google get mine has the FED at least had those the world champion to know the ability of alphago let's see how I feel go has played first match
on the 102nd move the Alcoa has shown to us was bit awkward given the Blackstone Reit that don't has jurisdiction alphago the Whitestone borrowed the bright side of Blackstone of chicken and later it turned out to be on skill of God the white stones 102nd move was bluffing this men's alphago try to disagree says all in order to cheat at Sabetha Kansas
this money eventually refuted basic card with them of computer and Coach huge couch two commentators and people who are watching the match and even to Lisa.
Lisa doll later admitted he's the fit at 186 move and alphago won the game by White Marsh
people were expecting Lisa. Victoria has blame Lisa dose in the pension and food for the next match unfortunately the second match and the match after we're also conquered by alpha dogs were people accused in the saddle and criticize that Lisa has only to qualify for representing mankind
alphago which Lisa door is playing against has total 1202 CPUs and 176 GB used on top of that it's system is connected with 1,000 server in plain language there are 1,200 to professional golf players and one Lisa Lowe is playing against each other
this 1200 to go players can calculate 100000 possible moves in one second and you can obtain manuals of govind few months whereas human needs to spend it how I feel like
what Lee sedol is playing against has already acquired Lisa. Historic data and knows him more than Lisa. Knows about alphago
nevertheless Lisa don't never gave up and one March 13th at 4 smack reschedule has won his first game against I thought though
Lisa Dolan twin is just not a victory for victory of mankind and it has before human dignity
although it was only one win Lisa those Angeles airport and toughness will leave us valuable Legacy of great room and spirit thank you for watching
