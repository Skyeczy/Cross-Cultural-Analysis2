this Sunday live on the WWE Network with the world watching in the right City in which this country was founded you will remember this
a flag match
in 1/4 the flag of Bulgaria
in the other corner of the flag of the United States of America
but the reason you will remember the flag match this Sunday is because you will remember one of two things
the flag of the United States of America waving in Victory
with the victory of the flag of Bulgaria will that flag fly
or will that flag fall
I can already hear how you feel about that and that squarely rests on my shoulders so I came out here tonight very simple I just want to tell you that I'm ready
this Sunday this flag will fly
guitar full of American Pride in Birmingham
what's up
Sears Parts Sunday at Battleground who self blindsided John Cena
setting up with an ambush an hour or hate him the same Private John Cena has in his country our country Rousseff has in his whole area almost superhuman strength of John Cena
pride of France up around 7 Up singing all the super athlete 300-plus pounds on the back of Cena
somebody's got to stop roseff
Cena looks like he's out he's out
Elitch's
I have a question I have this happens on Sunday that at Battleground the Bulgarian flag will be flying in the birthplace of our country and that man right there Rusev will be the one way
never understand what I'm saying is not the only proud man in this ring
all right on this this computer scene we are forced to witness this Sunday Cena was ambushed from behind here tonight on Smackdown live or 7 making a statement
