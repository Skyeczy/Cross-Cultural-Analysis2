we human beings with a species that and that's the world to us instead of adapting to the world we make things the things I said front with machine learning is that we don't even have to make those things anymore the world whether it's a computer or whether to Smart how's the weather this week I think it's by self what it was what you want and what's best for you and it does it on its own cancer is a really complex disease and it's not going to you know be cured the same way that many others have been by finding one drug that cures it it's going to take machine learning of you know how cells work and you know how Gene regulatory networks work and then you know it you'll figure out for different tumors right cuz everybody's cancers different if the from what different drugs to use for different rooms it's more knowledge than a single human being can never have the organs that are you know deployed in Industry they don't realize that people change their behavior in response to the model
same model what people do and then you deploy Your solution as if it were going to continue to behave that way but the people whether they Sharp Shoppers are front stairs or whatever they will change their behavior what we have today in factories is robot pet pick up you know the same object in the same configuration again and again and in typical they were program to pick up the object and they have no flexibility in in in in how they do it the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms they can actually pick up the object with much more flexibility in the greater variety of conditions lilang and positions and what not so it's a big Improvement but we wish you money today if I want to pick up a cup I need to turn the computer to pick up at 10 and then if I want I want the robots to pick up a bottle I need to train it again from scratch to pick up the bottle was You and I by the time you were three-years-old we knew how to pick up cups and balls and everything else that is actually not something that a eye experts take very seriously because just because they can please get very intelligent
find me there a danger to us computers are really an extension of our own intelligence we designed them just to achieve a particular goal and as long as all they're doing is working on that goal the more intelligent they are the more profit they are the better I think what people need to worry more about is all the mistakes that computers already make because you're not smart enough you know they they don't give credit to someone who should or they fight someone has a potential you know criminal that they shouldn't or they give the wrong diagnosis in the short-term I think there are real concerns there are a lot of jobs that will disappear like we're simply how's the truck driver I'd be very worried because you know automated trucks are on their way we need to make sure that those people can find out the jobs that they can return themselves that they can find other things that they do and I think they will be other things because I'm going to know why people worried about you no jobs being lost because it's easier to see the jobs that I lost than to see the ones that I created I think in the very long-term maybe computers and robots will be better than him
look at everything I think in that long time nobody will have a job but nobody will want or even neither think about having a job people won't think about a high unemployment rate as a bad thing they will think of a high employment rate is a bad thing
