big data Internet of things and artificial intelligence the reach of the fourth Industrial Revolution can be felt it almost every industry its impact can also be clearly felt in the health sector I'll give me some resumes in on the Wind of Change brought on by these Technologies
72 year old funky town is visiting the doctor to see how the surgery went just a week ago hung. Artificial joint Replacements and both legs just got worse until it reached the point where I could hardly walk I came here because I had it did robotic surgery
the surgical robot enables surgeons to do knee or hip replacements using 3D computer Imaging based on a CT scan making the robot remove the areas of bone ass knocked out by the surgeon
the biggest advantage of the robotic surgery is precision it has a margin of error of less than half a millimeter in surgery operations compared with a surgeon's 5 mm optimal implant size and positioning means less pain a faster recovery and a better outcome for patients us and Korea Food and Drug safety Ministries as of 2017 and is now being used in more than 13 hospitals in Korea
it's not those robots that are supporting doctors artificial intelligence is also being used to analyze enormous amounts of data diagnose illnesses and provide a treatment plan for cancer patients
in this room seven doctors are discussing treatment options for a uterine cancer patient one of the doctors a supercomputer this AI computer is loaded with 12 million cancer research papers and medical cases and then compares the data with a patient's genetic records after a round of discussion surgery than chemotherapy is announced that the best treatment option since adopting watts in a year ago the hospital has treated over 550 cancer patients with a super-computer accumulating data and making Corrections whenever the computer program gives a wrong answer the decision concordance rate between a i n human doctors went up by around 7% over the past year and satisfaction among patients is high
multidisciplinary approach with doctors from various departments working with AI instead of one-on-one doctor to Patient treatment is changing medical Diagnostics Healthcare Market alone is projected to reach 6.6 billion US Dollars by 2021 and expand into areas like preventive care high cost and improving accuracy are still challenges for the robotics Nai industry but what was once considered just hype is slowly becoming a new reality of Health Care Sheet Metal
