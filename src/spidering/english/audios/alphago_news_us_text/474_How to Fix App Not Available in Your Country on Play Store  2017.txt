what's a days of winter and Prudence video I'm going to show you how to install the applications that are not available to download in the country or in the location that you need to download applications like the Spotify music app is not available to download in India but in this week I'm going to show you how to do that thing so you need a VPN application and the application that I would suggest is gold Colonel beer to just go to Play Store and search for another beer and then install this application and once the app has been installed just Teppan open and you will see a very clean yet minimalistic interface so what you going to do is you going to swipe all the your way to the USA USA is that because every application on the Play Store is available to download in United States if anybody at the option that says United say the step on it and then just a pain yes and it will start connecting
no one seat has been connected now what you going to do next is that you going to go to the settings of your Play Store and then you going to clear the cache as well as clear the data of the Google Play Store when is Beast clear the cache clear the data no come back to the Play store and then just search for the application that you were not able to install previously what is ample in our case it is Spotify music application so I can just search for Spotify music list of users will get the diss around again that says this item isn't available in your country know what I would suggest is that just use any other email ID that you have for example if I change my email ID to the other email ID that I have and search for the Sea map again then you will see that it now shows the install option and there is no longer any error that says this app is not available in your country so that's how you can easily installed applications that are not available in the location where you live or in the country for example the Spotify app so that's it for this video if you like then to subscribe for more video of shit is
give me the fence and I would get you in the next one
