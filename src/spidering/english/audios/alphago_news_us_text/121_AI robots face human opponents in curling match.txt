the robots also learn to take into account the stadiums temperature and humidity which affect the ice and for the first time ever the machines face human players in a curling game with three nail defeat the curling robots formulated strategies pretty well but failed to adjust two variables of the ice
the AI robots will be used for developing strategies and providing training support xalid. News
