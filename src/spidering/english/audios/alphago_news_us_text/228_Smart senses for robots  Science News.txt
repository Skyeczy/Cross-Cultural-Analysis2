smart robots are no longer the stuff of Science Fiction but intelligence is more than busting humans at board games it's basic physical skills to like turn the doorknob for opening a bag babies make sensory information from the world around them to figure out how to use their bodies and it arrived robots aren't quite as sophisticated in the past they feel pretty epicly I controlling their bodies but new improvements could go a long way to help machine sense the physical world and learn new skills based on what they see feel or hear some senses are more easily mastered than others if you have an iPhone you might interact with Siri and acoustically astute artificial intelligence that picks up on your speech patterns to better respond to questions Siri are you alive
status other senses are trickier take touch humans are bombarded with tactile information through skin temperature pressure or Texture researchers at the University of Colorado took a similar approach with a robot named Baxter they give it smart skin that translates a flooded vibration divided into simple messages on Voxer sensories can differentiate between 15 different textures touch sensors also need to be tough sailor a lot developed by team at Stanford where is durable sensors on curling wax soon it may be able to tell hard ground from grass or sand and adjust the way it's Grandpa's forward but there's a difference between sensing the world around you and actually doing something with that information researchers at UCLA gave their robot squishy sensitive finger pads in a plastic bag full of Cheerios the robot actually figure it out
close the bag on its own touch is a handy skill but staying upright is a pretty important one your inner ear eyes and feet I'll give you a sense of balance some robots like Atlas are equipped with body and leg sensors that do the same thing that was my ticket humble now and then but a new upgrade enables the bot to get right back up
what's up that's caring touch balance what about State lasers can tell a robot how far it is from an object or obstacle Google's driverless car also uses laser radar cameras and software to recognize the shape of a pedestrian or the outstretched arm of a cyclist other robots tackle even more complex visual challenges star is a surgical robot senses that go beyond human abilities that has 3D and near infrared camera like wearing night vision goggles you can see glowing dots Market by humans on tissue calculator message plan and sew up a live-in and maybe one day a human patient Stars makers hope to add more superhuman senses to like measuring blood flow
things that seem like baby steps for humans are giant leaps for robot kind especially robots designed to work in the real world sticky bad for example is a gecko inspired robot that use special toe pads in jail Wahl micro tags are teeny tiny robots that can haul materials hundreds of times their body weight smart physical sensors can make these Bots more aware of their environment that allow them to focus on more complex task one day such sensitive robots might not work for us or against us but alongside us
