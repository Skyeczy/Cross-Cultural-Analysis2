what's up guys this is Randy with arena games and I just found out some pretty interesting news that you guys might want to know about seems that Shonen Jump is announced that after their April main issue of Shonen jump that they're discontinuing
magazines
why they're doing that I don't know a lot of people are saying on forms that it might be because of all the promos being stolen out of the books
it does happen a lot to do lose a lot of sales on that
kind of sucks for people like me who just paid for
30 plus subscriptions for my store so I'm losing out on some issues which kind of sucks but for the gaming world that's going to suck even more because we lose I'm getting exclusive promos like this in the magazine
that can be pretty big for us I'm kind of hoping that they figure out another way around it and maybe I know that they're doing online issues now digital maybe now shipping the promos or something like that but I guess we'll find out anyway that's it for now because I catch you later
