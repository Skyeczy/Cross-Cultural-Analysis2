5년뒤 AI가 대체할 직업은?...인공지능과 협업 시대 준비 시급Ever since the landmark match this month between Korean Baduk master Lee Se-dol and Google's DeepMind computer program AlphaGo, public interest has grown in Artificial Intelligence.Many are also wondering if these programs could eventually take over some jobs from humans.Kim Mok-yeon reports.With the continuous development of smart technology worldwide, and President Park Geun-hye's plans to boost South Korea's Artificial Intelligence Industry, people have been questioning, up to what extent could AI take over?If these robots could replace humans, which jobs would be at high risk?The Korea Employment Information Service unveiled the list of jobs in Korea that could be replaced by AI in the next five years.It mostly included jobs that involve repetitive tasks or those that require less communication.Among some 400 jobs, concrete workers topped the list followed by butchers, plastic and rubber producers, security guards and tax administrators, in that order.Delivery men, gas station workers and baby sitters were also included in the top 30 jobs that could be at risk. Among professional jobs, under-writers, general practitioners and air traffic controllers had relatively higher risks.On the other hand, occupations that require human emotions, especially in the arts and music sector, had lower possibilities of getting replaced.Artists and sculptors were the least replaceable followed by photographers, music composers, musicians and ballet dancers.Actors, designers and teaching professionals also had low possibilities of replacement.The Korea Employment Information Service said that it based its research on a model created by Oxford University's Frey and Osborne in 2013."I think this could be a good opportunity to cooperate with these robots and improve overall outcome by allowing them to take over the simple and repetitive tasks and make humans focus on more valuable work."Experts say that it is necessary to develop a social agreement about the roles of Artificial Intelligence in our society before 2020.Kim Mok-yeon, Arirang News.Visit ‘Arirang News’ Official PagesFacebook(NEWS): http://www.facebook.com/newsarirangHomepage: http://www.arirang.comFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/arirangtvTwitter: http://twitter.com/arirangworldInstagram: http://instagram.com/arirangworld
