Google's computer program AlphaGo Wednesday unexpectedly defeated world Go champion Lee Se-Dol of South Korea in the first of their five-game match, taking a 1-0 lead with an automatic victory by a wide margin. Lee, the reigning world champion of the ancient Chinese board game Go for the past 10 years, was shockingly defeated in Seoul, South Korea by AlphaGo, a program developed by Google's London-based artificial intelligence (AI) arm. Seen as a representative match between humans and AI, it drew great attention from media, Go fans and general public across the world. The five-game match will run through next Tuesday, with the second game set to be held on Thursday. AlphaGo took the world by surprise as it defeated European Go champion Fan Hui in October last year, though some experts had predicted it would take decades for AI to defeat humans. Go, which originated in China more than 2,500 years ago, has been viewed as a grand challenge for AI due to its complexity and intuitive nature. It involves two players, who take turns putting markers on a grid-shaped board to gain more areas on it. One can occupy the markers of the opponent by surrounding the pieces of the other.More on: http://newscontent.cctv.com/NewJsp/ne...Subscribe us on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmv5...CCTV+ official website: http://newscontent.cctv.com/LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/cctv...Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/CCTV/7...Twitter: https://twitter.com/NewsContentPLUS
