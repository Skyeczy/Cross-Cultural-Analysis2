Twitter @bartosiasticsOriginal Article: http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/21174...What do you get when you mix a bunch of nerds from Microsoft with Twitter and a teenaged girl? No, not Chris Hansen. While it sounds like a good way to catch a predator, Microsoft engineers introduced a chat bot named Tay with the handle @TayTweets last week. The bot was made as an AI experiment with the aim of researching conversational understanding, with Tay being able to learn from her Twitter conversations with people and get progressively smarter. Sounds innocent enough. But whenever you get a glimmer of hope for the future of humanity, people show up and ruin the party. What started off with an innocent “Hello world” quickly devolved into a very naughty, feminist-hating cyber Hitler youth. And nobody likes Hitler youths. Microsoft did Nazi that coming. After a profanity laced, racist, misogynist, anti-Semitic tirade developers quickly took Tay down.Developers created Tay to speak like a teen girl in order to improve the customer service on their voice recognition software. Great idea. Let’s put teenage girls in charge of the robots. A legion of Bieber bots running around with spray-painted tattoo arms, braiding hair, baby-sitting little brothers, back at it again with the white vans.Here at Zacks we’ve got our own AI bot. It’s called Black Box Trader. I always wondered, if Black Box Trader had a voice what would it say? That’s one smart robot. Among many smart robots that companies have made over the years. We all know IBM’s Deep Blue. The computer that very famously defeated, maybe cheated, Gary Kasparov in 1997. More recently you’ve got the DeepMind AlphaGo program beating South Korea’s Lee Se-dol in Go. a 2,500 year old game that looks like a third grade math teacher’s dreams. Then in the world of make believe you’ve got AI bots like the Terminator, Rosie from the Jetsons, Al Gore, and my personal favorite, the Fembots from Austin Powers.
