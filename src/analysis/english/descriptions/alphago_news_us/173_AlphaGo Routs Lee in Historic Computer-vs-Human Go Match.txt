The historic computer-vs-human being go-chess matchoff concluded Tuesday with AlphaGo the computer taking its fourth win in five matches, beating Lee Sedol the human grandmaster once more. AlphaGo already won the series after it defeated the South Korean in three straight matches before Tuesday in South Korea. It also collected the 1 million U.S. dollar prize which will be donated to charity causes. Lee only managed to get one match back in the fourth of the serial match-ups. Pundits say that despite the sweeping victory, it is still too early to say that artificial intelligence has surpassed human intelligence in go-chessing. One commentator said Lee lacked knowledge on computation which generates AlphaGo's playing strategy and tactics. Others suggested that only after analyzing AlphaGo's mindset sufficiently and holding a re-match between the AI and the human player, it may then help decide the oneupmanship on the go-chess board. On Tuesday, Lee and AlphaGo traded 280 moves in five hours. It was the most time-consuming match of the series. The 33-year-old South Korean played a tight game with 2-year-old AlphaGo. Lee has won 18 world championship titles during his 21 years of professional career. He has recorded a winning rate of about 70 percent with 47 victories in professional tournaments. Originated in ancient China, Go-chess is known as Baduk in South Korea. The game has many players throughout the world, with China, South Korea and Japan having produced the most of top-notch players of all.More on: http://newscontent.cctv.com/NewJsp/ne...Subscribe us on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmv5...CCTV+ official website: http://newscontent.cctv.com/LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/cctv...Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/CCTV/7...Twitter: https://twitter.com/NewsContentPLUS
