토종 인공지능 '아담' 가상현실과 첫 결합A Korean company recently unveiled the first home-grown system in the country to merge artificial intelligence and virtual reality.Park Se-young fills us in on how the nation's AI technologies are quickly catching up to those of Google's AlphaGo and IBM's Watson.A Korean company has given the country its first homegrown artificial intelligence software program called ADAMs.When the user puts on a VR headset and gives a command, ADAMs begins a visual journey into its sea of knowledge.The platform was developed over twenty years and is the first to combine artificial intelligence and virtual reality.The system has already acquired eight billion pieces of data from various fields, and can communicate in Korean.It will eventually be applied to the financial sector and the field of medicine, just like IBM's Watson can.Exobrain, a robot based on the ADAMs platform, recently participated in a quiz show and won.Other robots can be developed to attend to customers or work on behalf of disabled people."We've developed an optimization technology that handles various learning processes and exhibits artificial intelligence using modest capacity. We believe this will make our platform globally competitive."By next spring, the firm will launch a virtual assistant for smartphones and smart speakers based on the ADAMs platform.And in 2018, the firm will show off a new system called Eve that can communicate freely in five languages.Park Se-young, Arirang News.
