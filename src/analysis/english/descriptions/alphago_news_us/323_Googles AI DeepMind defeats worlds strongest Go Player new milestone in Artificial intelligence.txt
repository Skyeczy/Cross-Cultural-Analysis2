Hi, this is Emma, and welcome to Esoteric Detective. Google's AI DeepMind defeats world's strongest Go Player reaching new milestone in Artificial intelligenceAnother massive milestone in computer Artificial intelligence has been passed, with Google's A I computer, Deed Mind, defeating, for the first time in history, one of the highest ranked human players in our world at the board game Go, champion Lee Sedol, from south Korea. Last month Google's A I, beat a master Go player in what was called a landmark in artificial intelligence. And now only a month later, its skill has seemed to increased tenfold, and has evolved into an computer player that just took out a world ranked grandmaster. Go has been described as one of the 'most complex games ever devised by man' and has trillions of possible moves, but Google recently stunned the world by how well its A I program has not only learned the game, but is now beating the world's top players. While there are still four games left in the Challenge Match, this marks the first time in history that a computer program has defeated a top-ranked human Go player on a full 19x19 board with no handicap.  Demis Hassabis, Co-founder and boss of DeepMind, said, 'What an incredibly exciting game. Lee Sedol is a formidable opponent, famed for his fighting style, and AlphaGo decided to go toe-to-toe with him, which made for a tense, close-fought game. What do you guys think? Do you think this is just the beginning? Is there really any human game left, that A I cannot beat us at?Stay tuned and subscribe to Esoteric Detective, to keep up-to-date with the strange and unusual.
