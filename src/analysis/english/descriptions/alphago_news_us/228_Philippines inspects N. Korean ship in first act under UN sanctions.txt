필리핀, 북한 선박 검색…첫 제재 조치 이행The government of the Philippines has inspected a North Korea freighter... in one of the first acts mandated by new UN Security Council sanctions against Pyongyang.Bruce Harrison joins me in the studio now with more on the inspection.Bruce, countries around the world aren't wasting anytime implementing these tough, new sanctions.This ship, Connyoung, is one of 31 North Korean vessels that's covered under the harsher measures against Pyongyang. And the inspection is a sign that at least some UN nations are ready to follow through with the mandates,... which were approved unanimously... and that means... with the support of China.Bruce, the ship is being held in port by the Philippines for now. Tell about the results of the inspection and... why it's not being allowed to leave. The Filipino Coast Guard did not find anything suspicious on the Jin Teng. They took dogs trained to detect explosives on board and searched the ship and checked crew documents. The Coast Guard said the ship was still being held because the inspection revealed several minor safety problems, including issues with firefighting and electrical equipment.The Coast Guard said the cannot leave port until those issues are fixed.Experts in the shipping industry told Reuters the owners of UN blacklisted ships would have trouble getting the vessel insured, refueled or even call at foreign ports. One shipping lawyer told the news agency such ships may be prevented from trading to most places as a result.However, another lawyer said that the vessel might be able to continue some trade, because it would be up to individual member countries to pass legislation to enforce the UN sanctions.Visit ‘Arirang News’ Official PagesFacebook(NEWS): http://www.facebook.com/newsarirangHomepage: http://www.arirang.comFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/arirangtvTwitter: http://twitter.com/arirangworldInstagram: http://instagram.com/arirangworld
