In this commentary, Michael Redmond 9P and Chris Garlock, Managing Editor of the American Go E-Journal take a look at another game from the great master Honinbo Dosaku 9p. This is a game where Dosaku 9p played against Yasui Chitetsu 7p, and some of Dosaku's play in this game reminded Michael Redmond 9p of of AlphaGo's moves.http://www.usgo.org/news/2017/05/redm...
