SOUNDBITE (Korean) Lee Sedol, Professional Go Player:"I feel sad that the challenge match is over, and also I wanted to make a successful end, but I feel sorry for not being able to make it. In fact, at the beginning of this match, I thought I had a bit more of an advantageous position, but the fact that I have lost despite (such an advantageous start) shows that I lack in (playing abilities), I think." 7. Wide of Lee and Hassabis8. SOUNDBITE (Korean) Lee Sedol, Professional Go Player:"I am not quite sure whether I would be able to win this game even if I get another opportunity to compete with AlphaGo again, because it has such a high level of concentration. Certainly, humans cannot catch up in terms of concentrating ability, rather than playing capability. I cannot admit that (AlphaGo) has a better playing capability, though."9. Wide of news conference10. SOUNDBITE (English) Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind:"As we said before, we've learnt many things I think that AlphaGo and things we can improve. We wont know for sure until we go back home to the UK and analyse everything over the next few weeks, and then we will think about what we do next. If we will play more matches or maybe we will make some kind of release at some point for the general public. We have to decide all these things. We haven't decided yet."11.
