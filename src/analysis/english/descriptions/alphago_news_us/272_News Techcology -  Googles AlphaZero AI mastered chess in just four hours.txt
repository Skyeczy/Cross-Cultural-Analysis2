News Techcology -  Google's AlphaZero AI mastered chess in just four hoursGoogle's latest artificial intelligence, AlphaZero, has defeated one of the best chess programs in the world after learning the game from scratch in just four hours.The 'superhuman' AlphaZero AI played 100 games against rival computer program Stockfish 8, and won or drew all of them.The AI is the work of Googe's DeepMind division, and is the latest in a series of incredible AI achievements by the company.An earlier version of the machine, dubbed AlphaGo, was able to defeat the world's top human players of the Chinese board game Go.The results of the achievement were published in a report by researchers from Google's DeepMind in London this week.They found that the technology could go up against a powerful chess software, that has been in development for nearly a decade, and still win.In 100 games played against Stockfish, Google's AI won 28 and drew the rest - after just four hours of training.Writing in a research paper about the project, shared via the electronic print repository Arxiv, its authors said: 'AlphaZero achieved within 24 hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go, and convincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case.'Stockfish 8, which was released in 2008, had previously won 2016's Top Chess Engine Championship.The open source software has  been beaten by another program, Komodo, in two major computer chess challenges.But one chess grandmaster was still impressed with Googe's victory.'I always wondered how it would be if a superior species landed on Earth and showed us how they played chess,' Peter Heine Nielsen told the BBC. 'Now I know.'The AI was also able to beat an AI program called Elmo in the Japanese board game Shogi, after two hours of self-training.It won 90 games, drew two and lost eight.With hours of self-training it was also able to beat an earlier version of itself at the ancient Chinese game of Go.The latest win follows a series of achievements by Google's DeepMind division.One version of the Alpha Go AI, created in 2015, proved it could do better than humans on dozens of Atari video games from the 1980s, like video pinball, boxing, and 'Breakout.'A new version of the software, called AlphaGo Zero, which learned to play simply by playing games against itself, was unveiled in October.Demis​ ​Hassabis,​ ​co-founder​ ​and​ ​CEO of DeepMind said at the time: 'It's amazing to see just how far AlphaGo has come in only two years.'AlphaGo Zero is now the strongest version of our program and shows how much progress we can make even with less computing power and zero use of human data.'Previous versions of AlphaGo were initially trained on thousands of human amateur and professional gamers, to learn how to play Go.But AlphaGo Zero skipped this step and learned to play simply by playing games against itself, starting from completely random play.AlphaGo Zero played at super-human level, became disciplined and used multiple challenges across the board. During testinSource:  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetec...
