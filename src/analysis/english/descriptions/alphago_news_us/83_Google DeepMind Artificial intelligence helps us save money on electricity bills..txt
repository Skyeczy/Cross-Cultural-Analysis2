Google DeepMind: Artificial intelligence helps us save money on electricity bills.The artificial intelligence of Google, DeepMind, we already proved his ability when he beat the considered best player in the world Go through AlphaGo. That singular confrontation ignited the debate on the future of artificial intelligence, but it was actually just one of the many applications of this discipline. The advantages of using this technology span many disciplines, but could also evident in our economy. The perfect example has given Google, which has saved a lot of money on electricity bills thanks to the management by DeepMind in their data centers. There are several areas in which Google seems to be interested in harnessing the power and capacity DeepMind, and proposals have already been made both in the world of StarCraft game, the protagonist and medical applications. But where it does seem to have worked this artificial intelligence engine is Google own servers. By studying the consumption of their servers and learning about different parameters of the same Deepmind 15% managed to improve the efficiency of electric power PUE. Denis Hassabis, co-founder of DeepMind, explained that this platform controls about 120 variables in data centers, such as fans or refrigeraci√≥n.nUn systems savings in energy consumption is important for us. #DeepMind #Google #AlphaGo #GO #Google #tech #news #technology
