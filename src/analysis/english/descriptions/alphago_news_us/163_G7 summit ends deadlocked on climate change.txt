G7 summit ends deadlocked on climate changeGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel has called the debate at a G7 summit in Italy "very unsatisfactory", saying that US President Donald Trump's G7 partners remained in the dark about his intentions on climate change. Her comments came on the final day of the Sicily event, where international leaders were trying to persuade Trump to stay in a landmark climate change deal.  Trump has tweeted that he will make his final decision on the issue next week. Al Jazeera's Laurence Lee reports from the summit in the town of Taormina.  - Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe- Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish- Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera- Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/
