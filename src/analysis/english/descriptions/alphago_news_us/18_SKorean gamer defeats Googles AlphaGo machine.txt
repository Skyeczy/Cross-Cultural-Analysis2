SOUNDBITE (Korean) Lee Sedol, Professional Go player:"I am much more happy because I got to win after the previous losses. This one victory is priceless that cannot be replaced by any other thing. I am very happy, and I think I could win at least one game. Thanks to many of you supporting and encouraging me. Thank you."10. Lee, Hassabis, and Silver11. SOUNDBITE (Korean) Lee Sedol, Professional Go player:"Of course it was stressful because the results were not good, but because I had played the Go matches so pleasantly, I want to say again that (the defeats) were not that much stressful to give me a big internal injury. Anyway, I no longer feel so stressed because I won this (fourth) match. To answer to the second question, because I won this match with white stones, I want to play with black stones in the last, fifth match. As winning with black stones is more worthwhile than winning with white stones, I want to win using black stones in one (last) match."12. Lee, Hassabis and Silver13. SOUNDBITE (English) Demis Hassabis, Chief Executive  of Google DeepMind:"Actually we are also very happy because this is why we came here, to test AlphaGo to its limits and find out what its weaknesses were, so we can try to improve the programme. But, you know...because we need a creative genius like Lee Sedol to be able to find out these issues, and actually expose them."14. News conference15. Lee, Hassabis, and Silver16. Lee, Hassabis, and Silver leavingSTORYLINE:A champion Go player scored his first win over Go-playing computer software on Sunday after losing three straight times in the ancient Chinese game.In a news conference following the game in Seoul, Lee Sedol said he couldn't be happier about his victory.Lee Sedol's victory over AlphaGo served as a reminder that Google's Go-playing programme is not perfect and has room for improvement. Lee had said that he lost earlier games because he could not find any weaknesses in AlphaGo's strategy.AlphaGo — the first computer system to defeat a top Go player — had already clinched the best-of-five series and the one-million US Dollars prize, which will be donated to charity. The artificial intelligence computer programme was developed by Google DeepMind two years ago.===========================================================Clients are reminded: (i) to check the terms of their licence agreements for use of content outside news programming and that further advice and assistance can be obtained from the AP Archive on: Tel +44 (0) 20 7482 7482 Email: info@aparchive.com(ii) they should check with the applicable collecting society in their Territory regarding the clearance of any sound recording or performance included within the AP Television News service (iii) they have editorial responsibility for the use of all and any content included within the AP Television News service and for libel, privacy, compliance and third party rights applicable to their Territory.You can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/you...
