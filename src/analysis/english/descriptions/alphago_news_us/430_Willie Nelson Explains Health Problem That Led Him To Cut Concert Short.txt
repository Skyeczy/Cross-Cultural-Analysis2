Willie Nelson ended a concert early in Salt Lake City, Utah, blaming it on the altitude. In his explanation on Twitter, he wrote, “…I am feeling better now & headed for lower ground.” The 84-year-old singer recently faced false reports that he had passed away. Nelson has tour dates scheduled through the end of November.
