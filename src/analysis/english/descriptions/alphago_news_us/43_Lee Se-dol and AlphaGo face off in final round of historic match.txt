이세돌 vs 알파고, 5국Korea's Lee Se-dol,... grandmaster of the game of Baduk... or Go as it's known around the world... and artificial intelligence super computer AlphaGo are about to face off one more time in the final round of the historic match pitting human against machine.The match gets started at 1PM here in Korea,... under an hour from now.For more, we connect to Lee Ji-won, who's at the Four Seasons hotel in Seoul, where the games are taking place.Ji-won, AlphaGo has already been declared the victor in the best-of-five series, but Lee Se-do pulled off an upset over the weekend that seemed to show that AI hasn't caught up to humanity just yet.As with all the other days,... everyone is pulling for Lee Se-dol today...That's right, Mark.Regardless of what happens today,... the one-million U.S. dollar cash prize and the bragging rights will go to Google and Team DeepMind, but everyone here is really hoping Lee Se-dol can go out on a high note.There's extra anticipation this afternoon as Lee Se-dol pulled off an amazing win in the fourth match on Sunday.The AI system couldn't handle Lee's skillful play and was forced to call it quits.After the game, Lee Se-dol said he had identified two weaknesses in AlphaGo's play.One is that AlphaGo was weaker when it played first, holding the black stones.The other is that, when Lee made an unexpected, creative move,... AlphaGo seemed confounded and made mistakes Team DeepMind agree that AlphaGo has higher winning rate when it plays second with the white stones.Lee Se-dol suggested to the DeepMind team that AlphaGo play its favored white stones in this afternoon's game so he can challenge himself and hopefully steal the AI system's thunder. Well, everyone in Korea and perhaps the whole of humanity hopes the human grandmaster can win this game and end the series three-two.Perhaps if he does, we can expect a rematch soon.Well, that's all I have for now.Back to you Mark.
