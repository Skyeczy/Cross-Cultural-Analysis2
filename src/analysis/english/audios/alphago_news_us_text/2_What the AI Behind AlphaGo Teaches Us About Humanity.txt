game 1 surprise Go Master usidore
came to let him speechless and in game 3 he felt powerless
set all came back to win in game 4 but the final game ended with Google's alphago defeating The Go Master again a computer that beating the best go player in the world 41
the weight of this defeat start a certain sadness and many people around the world because I'm like chess go as a complex game that requires human intuition and creativity or so it was thought
alphago system uses deep neural networks which approximates the web of neurons in the human brain these networks learn to perform tasks by analyzing large amounts of Digital Data the alphago team took it a step farther using reinforcement learning they set up countless matches in which different versions of alphago played each other so alphago learns from Human moves and then it develops its own strategy to understand how humans play but it can also look beyond that to play an entirely different level of the game this may seem frightening but the reality is that the technology is at the heart of alphago are the future of poised to reinvent everything from robotics to scientific research
in the years to come as we humans work with these machines are genius will only grow in tandem with our Creations well hopefully so don't you it is human versus machine but rather human and machine
