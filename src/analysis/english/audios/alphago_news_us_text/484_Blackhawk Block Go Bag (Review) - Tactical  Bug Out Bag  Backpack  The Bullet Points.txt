okay so to go over the sum of the specs on the at Blackhawk and go back there block go bag is a pretty cool bag this is pretty new for them they're getting really into the kind of bail out bag and go bag of these products do some pretty cool as you can see for 72-hour bag not that big it's pretty small I think they would probably even admit that this is probably more like a 1-2-2 day bag good for having a vehicle something like that if there's an emergency you can't get home or you have a rendezvous Point you're trying to meet up with friends or family something like that this is great for throwing the back of the vehicle this is awesome for that but this is pretty cool so I'm starting on the outside here it comes with these kind of heavy duty zipper so they're nice they can I have these These are really nice. Hydration pouch or just outside pocket here on the front of it
you can see it's got what they call other Blackhawk a strike webbing all the way through out Scott candles on each side
and then on the top right here pretty nice setup the pads on the straps are pretty thick not too bad they're not as comfortable as something like you know full fledge like backpacking back some like that. The really thick padding they can approve on the thickness of the pads here when you're laying down as much as I have that would help out but I'm pretty comfortable it's nice that it has a flat right here outside with Comfort a little bit and distribute a little more evenly are all the straps are adjustable what's really nice is the straps actually come completely off so if you want to wear it as just a sling over one shoulder you can do that to you as an option which is really nice so it gives you getting some nice options there
now it's really cool is built into it which will get into it into the inside in the second and has a 7 mesh pouches that comes with so you can easily compartmentalize in a fire starting to your lights Maps Compass food in a water water filtration anything like that and they're clear so you can easily access them and also put in a little while pieces of paper label kind of watch what we're going to be inside in a second starting the outside would have thrown on here a little bit like a traveling traveling hobo bag of this point but on the outside he is really pretty comfortable to where I'm going to go and dive in my bag here and let you guys see what I have in here a little bit.
