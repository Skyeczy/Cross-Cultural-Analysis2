artificial intelligence is part of the new frontier in medicine it's the topic of this morning this morning of our series Grand rounds which is practice of medicine practice of medical professionals who teach other doctors about advancement in a new study we told you about earlier this week researchers at Google use an algorithm to analyze ice cans as a method for predicting heart disease artificial intelligence has been used to quickly analyze data do I identify patterns that can help speed up diagnosis and your treatment the combination of high-tech Computing and Hands-On medicine is transforming Medical Care are dr. David agus direct research on AI Thena versity of Southern California he also has USC's Westside Cancer Center he's a very busy dude but he don't exist at the table this morning good morning to you dr. David morning I'm still scared about the pay back and watch what I say but I think when you use a technical term in the green room it's so freaking cool to quote it that's what he
what about AI what excites you most to a eyes getting computers to do things that humans did before and so they can take over our tasks and Google this week show that if you look at the back of the eye is called the fundus there blood vessels there and they took $280,000 of scanned and now they can actually look in the back of one's I tell you your sex your age plus or minus 3 years they can tell you where your smoked your blood pressure and most importantly your risk for heart disease just by looking inside you're all done by computer all done by computer cuz they look for patterns of the human brain couldn't have seen but they saw the field where a I can really do wonders right it is doing wonders computers are better picking up tuberculosis that humans are you know imagine at your in the emergency room and there is a hundred X-rays at the address to look at it maybe the computer can look first to hit. Pay attention to this one cuz we think it may be pneumonia and that patient to be treated quicker cuz it go to the head of the line there x-ray so there's a lot of potential house
transform what we do is Physicians when you get excited about this we gotten excited about a lot of technological developments in the doctor's office or do you think about in the context of I'm at home staring into a retinal scanner and doing an at-home test you know I think there's certain tasks that doctors just aren't as good at so if you're looking under a microscope at breast cancer does one cancer cell you feel to 1000 sells a normal cancer normal cancer you were brains not that good at that the computer can do it all at once so they're 30 things it's going to take over and do really well other things will be in a perv you in the position they're still will be in always will be an art to Medicine the cool thing about AI it's going to make the good doctor is great and so that's what's exciting today yes we've been teasing that all morning how does that work well in the Google example of can look at the back of the eye
and for those blood vessels that can predict heart disease in England they use AI to look at patient's medical records and they were better at predicting who's going to get heart disease in the current algorithms of the American Heart Association the all of a sudden it's going to be added on to what we do is that where to get these Clues the computer going to say hey you should consider this cuz even though they don't meet the standard criteria we think they might have so much information in the eye David cuz it's in the eye you could see and you could see a little bit thicker in certain areas or not actually as an indicator of the blood vessels all over the body so it's an element that gives us Clues when they're looking to give you eye glasses and should be looking and could be could spot some other health concern concerns as well I have a question about about in privacy because certainly we could at one point reached a point where genetic information gets the data all gets loaded up into some cloud and that becomes both helpful and troublesome
George Bush pass the genetic nondiscrimination Dang Gina that a decade ago so it protects us from this but you're right there's the potential for overuse for potential using it for other things and we have to be very careful about security and about taking away identifiers we start to mine ore look at this information so it's something that needs governance we need to have somebody in charge make sure we use AI correctly to make sure we protect privacy and that we do it right in the long run in the right way we're actually going to make things better
