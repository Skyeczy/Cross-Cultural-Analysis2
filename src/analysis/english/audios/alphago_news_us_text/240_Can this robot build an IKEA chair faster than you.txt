universally awful experience of putting together Ikea furniture has led some scientists to wonder can robots just do this for us it turns out at ass like this is incredibly difficult for robots as well but for different reasons recent advances in robotics and artificial intelligence have produced box that can do everything from driving cars by themselves the beating world champion go players what that doesn't mean they can manipulate objects with Precision on their own that's because the ability to definitely move and rotate objects requires juggling many complex interactions at once humans do this everyday but for robots locating objects in space with visually invite touch planning out complex emotions control force and coordinating multiple alarms at once is a tremendous challenge
researchers wanted to see if they could meet that challenge by building a robot from commonly available Parts the robot was made of off-the-shelf Hardware industrial robot arms parallel grip for sensors in a 3D camera to monitor its environment first the robots can the room with the 3D camera to get to know its surroundings and figure out where all those annoying tiny Parts work then using open-source software the robot playing down at each and every move this was actually the most time-consuming part of the process finally a chair has been assembled in a record-breaking time of 8 minutes and 55 seconds including programming time the whole process took just over 20 minutes pretty impressive right
challenge people here at science to build the same kind of Ikea chair in the same amount of time the skills came easy the chair not so much are human contestants beat the robots time but just barely the humans didn't have any issue coordinating or planning usually doing everything all at once the real challenge was using those tiny Hex wrenches using artificial intelligence robots in the future could autonomously assemble furniture by simply reading the manual or even just analyzing an image of a completed chair until then maybe get a friend robot to help you out with that chair
