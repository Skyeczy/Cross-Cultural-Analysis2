the golden AI is to make a computer that's a smart as a human and if you read YouTube comments I shouldn't be too hard
hello artificial intelligence and Julian here for dnews computers are constantly getting better faster and stronger and they're really great at things were terrible at free sample tell me what's 1957 * 683. I don't think so and yet we still consider them dumb if being amazing at Rock calculations doesn't make them smart at what point is a machine considered intelligent the most famous test of artificial intelligence is the Turing test basically a computer passes the Turing test if you can chat with a human judge for 5 minutes and Fulton judge into thinking it's human 30% of a time aside for one controversial effort in 2014 were a chatbot snuck past the judges by lowering expectations the Turing test remains unbeaten that might be in part because not many people are trying to beat it the Turing test isn't brought enough in scope to be the be-all-end-all Benchmark for a I test the machine can make a judgement about an image or use common sense reasoning so more challenges have been sent forth and little by little machine is starting to pass them researchers think and intelligent machine it should be able to interpret visual information
like when something is a face lo and behold on my phone I have an app that knows what shape to search for when I'm taking selfies so I can slap some dog years on me computers are also beating us at our own games lately Google's alphago algorithm the play the ancient Chinese game of Go like a boss was good enough to beat a go master and play like a pro and recognize my face is impressive but a machine that does one specific thing at a human level can't really be called intelligent we call that artificial narrow intelligence when really what we're looking for is artificial general intelligence to me that standard machine would have to do too many things at our level so The Human Stain for intelligence is to be like a human which sounds egotistical but it's really not the human mind is formidable because we can learn about so many completely unrelated things and we can do it even if we're not explicitly taught one person is capable of playing go and recognizing faces and having an open-ended conversation when computer is not the time machine learning comes in today computers can teach themselves given an update
my brother was going to start to write their own coat refining it over and over the most basic facial recognition code an algorithm rights might look for simple things like edges the next level add the ability to combine those Hedges into shapes like squares and rectangles are deeper and I can start to distinguish eyes and noses these algorithms need to look at thousands to millions of examples of faces but eventually their coats would be so good at looking for facial features that will be able to tell when two pictures are of the same person even the fellating is change the angles different and they've grown and sexy beard Facebook knows your friends are in a picture before you even tag them it's because they have a virtual book of face it's a smart machine will not just recognize specific people but also be able to generalize even if its face looks nothing like they've ever seen before they'll still recognize this ugly mug as human
not a sloth eventually if a machine can teach itself many different human traits and has the wrong horsepower to do it quickly and we considered artificially intelligent but I doubt it'll stop there it won't be long before they surpass human intelligence and obtain artificial superintelligence when that day comes maybe it'll be the machine protest humans to see if we can fool them you know the routine anytime anybody brings up a I will have to freak out about how they're going to be our overlords but of course there's another way of looking at it what if humanity and a I merge together Laura Ling from Secret stories explorers that question in this video where in a robot tells a joke these are on other new technologies so I hope you'll forgive me if I'm hard of hearing, I've got a long way to go from this humble beginning for example I still need them to give me antibiotic body but if you're not convinced that AI is actually going to be safe Trace shields for a robot overlords I mean our protectors in this video here musk donated $10 Alone 2
if you have a eye because he knows the computers are dumb we have to teach them morality ethics and empathy just like we train it to drive speak move cargo or play piano we have to recognize that humans are programming the AI and humans you know we kind of have biases after AI hits but before enslave Humanity it's going to have all sorts of uses safer self-driving cars better internet search of the you-name-it know I mean it tell us what you think okay I will have the most impact on in the world let us know down in the comment subscribe for more and I'll see y'all next time on dnews
