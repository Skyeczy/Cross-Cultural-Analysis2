Stanford doctoral candidate and ARL High Performance Computing Research Center (AHPCRC) collaborator, John Mern, discusses how recent developments in deep reinforcement learning enables computers to perform multi-agent cooperative actions through learning in simulated environments. At ARL, cooperative multi-agent control is being combined with extremely low-power computing devices, enabling future capabilities for the US Army in coordinated multi-agent autonomous systems with long-duration intelligent computing capabilities.
