Ji-won, tell us how it happened. Hi Mark.The third round of Baduk, also known as Go,... between grandmaster Lee Se-dol of Korea and artificial intelligence super computer AlphaGo ended on Saturday with another win for AlphaGo. After 176 moves and over four hours of a very close competition, Lee Se-dol forfeited, realizing that he can no longer with the game. Knowing that AlphaGo's chances of winning increases in the latter part of the game, Lee Se-dol played very aggressivley yet calmly. But AlphaGo's keen skills in Baduk and creative moves were beyond Lee Se-dol's skills. The remaining two games will still be held through Tuesday despite the fact AlphaGo has won the first three games.However,... the one-million U.S. dollar cash prize and the bragging rights go to AlphaGo and the DeepMind team.That's all I have for now.
