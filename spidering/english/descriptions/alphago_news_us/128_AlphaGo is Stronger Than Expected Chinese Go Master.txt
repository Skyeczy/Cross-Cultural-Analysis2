China's number one ranked Go player Ke Jie said Monday that Google's computer program AlphaGo is stronger than he expected, but for now he still believes he can defeat it.Ke made the remark ahead of the final match of the five-game series taking place in Seoul between AlphaGo and South Korean Go world champion Lee Sedol.AlphaGo, created by Google's artificial intelligence (AI) arm DeepMind, won the first three matches to secure victory in the human versus machine showdown, but Lee managed to defeat the computer program in the fourth game to bring the score to 3-1. The final match is scheduled to be held on Tuesday.Ke, the youngest ever three-time Go world champion, currently holds a head-to-head record of eight wins and two losses against Lee."At first, I firmly thought that Lee Sedol would whitewash AlphaGo 5-0, but later I thought that AlphaGo would beat Lee 5-0... My prediction was changing sharply. I think AlphaGo is really so amazing that I judged it incorrectly at first. Its Go strength really can reach the world's top level," said the 18-year-old.Despite AlphaGo's strength being beyond his expectations, Ke still believes he could achieve a 60 percent win rate against the computer program."In terms of probability, I have a chance to win, but the probability is not as high as I thought before. I think it is 60 percent in favor of me," said Ke.Ke said many professional Go players underestimated AlphaGo's strength prior to this series due to a lack of understanding about how the program works and because they have struggled to come to terms with the possibility of being beaten by AI."Perhaps Go players have always thought of ourselves as being too great or too strong, and haven't completely let go of our human dignity. In reality, it is a certainty that AlphaGo will beat the top human masters in the future, but it still needs a bit more time. But according to AI's pace of progress, there is no doubt about it, we can't avoid it. How to confront this also poses a great challenge to us as Go players," said Ke.More on: http://cctvplus.tv/NewJsp/news.jsp?fi...Subscribe us on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmv5...CCTV+ official website: http://newscontent.cctv.com/LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/cctv...Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/CCTV/7...Twitter: https://twitter.com/NewsContentPLUS
