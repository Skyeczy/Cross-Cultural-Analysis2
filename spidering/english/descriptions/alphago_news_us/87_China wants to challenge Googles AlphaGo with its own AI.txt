While computers have been playing, and winning, chess for decades, Google's DeepThought AI AlphaGo was only recently able to master the art of the incredibly complex game of Go. The game was created over 2,500 years ago in China, and now the Chinese are stepping up with their own Go-playing AI. Chinese researchers at China Computer Go say that they will have an AI capable of challenging Google's AlphaGo by the end of 2016, and they want a showdown. Google has not responded to the challenge yet, but there seems to be little reason for them to turn down the opportunity. A game of Go between two computers could be over in a matter of minutes, and it would be a great way to test the reasoning of both company's artificial intelligence.http://www.geek.com/news/china-wants-...http://www.wochit.comThis video was produced by YT Wochit News using http://wochit.com
