"Shaken baby syndrome" is back in the spotlight. On Friday, a leading doctor and expert witness, Dr Waney Squier, was found to have mislead courts by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service. She stands by her evidence. John Sweeney reported on the issue for Newsnight in 2007 - and interviewed Dr Squier. The babysitter featured in his report Suzanne Holdsworth was cleared of murder and freed in 2008.
