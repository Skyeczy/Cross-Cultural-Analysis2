It’s full of underutilized assets: hotel rooms lie empty, cars sit parked and un-used for over 90% of their lives, half empty shipping containers travel the world, overcrowded, poorly optimized transport infrastructure eats at our sanity, power grids have peaks and troughs in usage that are shocking and organizing even the simplest thing requires a herculean effort in hunting and gathering. In short, we live in an increasingly complex world that we must somehow find ever more ridiculous ways to adapt to rather than one that figures out how to adapt to us, and, for that matter, itself. Centralized systems are poorly placed to solve today’s complex problems as they can’t effectively work together to find solutions from the bottom-up. We propose an open, decentralized system where large numbers of simple things can cooperate—unsupervised—to solve problems without the need for prior exposure to them. Fetch solves this by creating a decentralized digital world where a collective super intelligence actively delivers answers to you: a world where information that benefits you and information that might benefit you is delivered effortlessly. Fetch brings the world closer together and delivers power to the individual. It provides solutions to problems that no one has yet dared to address, enabled by a system that can handle huge numbers of tiny transactions conducted by our digital representatives. Fetch doesn't fix the old economy; it presents an entirely new one. -----------------------Sources:https://fetch.aihttps://fetch.ai/technical-introductionhttps://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zer...https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artifi...https://vimeo.com/256954223https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/was...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix
