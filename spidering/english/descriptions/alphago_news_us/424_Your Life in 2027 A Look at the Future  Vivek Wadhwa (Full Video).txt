Between driverless cars and AI and gene modification technology, we're about to see a lot of very big changes in a short amount of time. But there's a danger of people rebelling because things moved too fast. Imagine an angry, jobless populace once driverless cars take away the transportation industry and electric cars take away the gas industry. Will politicians have to enact universal basic income? It's a sobering reminder that we are—as a country and as a species—still adapting to an every changing world. Even if it's a world that we designed. Vivek tackles this and a host of other issues (as well as some great things to look forward to) in our first long-form video.
