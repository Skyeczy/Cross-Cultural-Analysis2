Welcome to iCOMP's weekly series "The Week That Was in Business Analytics".This week we discuss AlphaGo's ground-breaking victory over Go champion Lee Se-Dol, IBM's Watson-powered hotel concierge robot "Connie" and the implications of Google Driverless cars. It all leads into a discussion on Big Data, Cognitive and  IoT cyber-security -- and we ask the big question: are we headed for a massive global "firesale", like that portrayed in "Live Free or Die Hard"?And does it matter, anyway, if we're all going to be able to upload our brains into a super-computer in 15 years, as Dmitry Itskov believes?Subscribe to catch us every Wednesday here on YouTube!Sign up for our mailing list here: http://icompbusiness.com/subscribe###Find iCOMP on social media:LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/icom...Twitter: https://twitter.com/icompbusinessInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/icompbusiness/###iCOMP Recommends:"The immortalist: Uploading the mind to a computer":http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-3578...###This week's news links:"Go champion Lee Se-Dol finally wins one game against AlphaGo": http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/13/111...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OV0H..."Hilton and IBM Pilot “Connie,” The World’s First Watson-Enabled Hotel Concierge":https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pr...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC0I0..."Google self-driving car crashes into a bus, while Volvo recruiting 100 people to commute in driverless cars next year": http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35...http://www.bbc.com/news/business-3574...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKQhQ...###Food for Thought:"IoT Security: are we headed for a big Firesale?"http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/24/why-...http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/dro...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Jz-8...###Intro videos:"Europe and Russia launches a joint mission to Mars searching for methane...and presumably fart jokes..."http://www.bbc.com/news/science-envir...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJAYw..."Spectacular displays of the Aurora Borealis spotted in parts of the UK....": http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35743466https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf5Wu...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS89e..."Scientists discover hydras have no mouth, so just rips itself open to eat...":https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCGaW...
