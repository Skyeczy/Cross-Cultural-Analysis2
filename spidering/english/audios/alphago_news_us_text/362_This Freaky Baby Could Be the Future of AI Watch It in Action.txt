what became famous for building super detailed simulations of the human body and ended up winning a couple of Oscars for his work on films like Avatar and King Kong these days Marcus how to put this trying to reverse engineer the human brain he's built a series of simulations around how the human face moves how to express emotion and how are neurons fire computers has experiences can imagine and basically it has its own set of existence anyway so now what we going to do is I'm going to run by the X
