well I think I'm really need to take a step back and look at what's going on in the artificial intelligence and deep learning field from a much broader perspective than just the specific Google story today there are so many applications that will be positive for Humanity across a wide variety of Industries in ways that will transform how we all work live in play so innocent I think this is a terrific accomplishment that has happened today but it doesn't show you the idea that the computer thinks on its own
well I think you really need to parse out what is really meant by thinking and what we consider to be true human level Intelligence being able to play a game with in a certain set of parameters and being able to parse out several layers of learning if you will to be able to come to what could be considered to be a novel solution is a breakthrough and a tour-de-force and definitely a positive bit of momentum in this area of artificial intelligence really going to get to that level of human level intelligence some significant advances are going to need to happen over the coming years and decades
