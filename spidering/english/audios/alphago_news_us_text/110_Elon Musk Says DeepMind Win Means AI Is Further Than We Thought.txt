Google's alphago Shock the World by defeating go legend Lisa doul yesterday this upset wasn't a fluke the AI program developed by Google's deepmind unit has just won the second game of the V game go matched not upon learning of alpha goes Victory SpaceX CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter to send his congratulations must says congrats too deep my mini experts in the field about the day I was 10 years away from achieving mess and the Beast that he's referring to you is the evaluative process that Africa was using to defeat this go champion in this match this is a very sarcastic tweet from Elon Musk in my opinion because they don't ask is the guy who didn't ate a 10 million dollars a few years ago to slow down AI it was Elon Musk along with Hulk and Bill Gates speaking out about the fact that if artificial intelligence gets ahead of the biological evolution of the human being that really I was species we could be in a lot of trouble so you don't box coming out
sorry against AI I think it was a sarcastic tweet from him I mean he has spoken out there was a statement that he released in January of last year where he was saying we need responsible artificial intelligence development which is basically saying we can't weaponize there so we're going to go into a Terminator situation and we've seen the government using drones and things of that nature in a very weaponize militarized way and so you know to that point what he was calling for was putting aaime hands of everyone in this very egalitarians everyone has it nobody will be trying to use it abuse it and that sort of way so it's very interesting I know you covered the story originally here at the live so this game of God it was created by I need the number of permutations and possible move during a game is more than the number of atoms in the universe to basically it's impossible for computer to just use algorithms to beat
opponent in usually want to play a game of go because you can't really figure out exactly what would be the best way to make you were looking at the your opponent's behave is you looking at your opponent's intuition you using skill yo using intuition and you're predicting Behavior patterns and basically having to adopt the way you play accordingly so what's happening with the robot isn't the case of self lighting and self adopting and the robot teaching itself and that's why this is so critical has to be bondsman's of a I teach itself something it didn't know already I'm adopting and letting off of human being Behavior to that point we've seen computers best chance you know I chest and other games like that were tend to be a little more calculated there aren't as many permutations of how to move around the board so again this is incredibly significant and Alpha goes victory means that it leads the series 2 2 0 and if he has any chance of pulling a victory he will need to come out on top and all three of them
reading games good luck but I'm kind of excited to see if alphago can win undefeated
