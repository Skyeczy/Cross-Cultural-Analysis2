blizzard and Google began collaboration on using deepmind to create an AI Starcraft 2 bot that will eventually be able to beat the best StarCraft players in the world using machine learning as it has with so many other games including most recently beating the top go player in the world a big wrench in the system includes the fog of War not allowing the computer to know what the other players doing without scouting using inputs like the map mini map and others deepmind will initially learn from watching years of top-tier gameplay footage from Starcraft tournaments then move on to live Human opponents in June I predicted the following when will AI be able to learn how to play any sports games and school all of us
5 years in the last few months Google deepmind beats the top go board game player in the world and learns curiosity and reward to complete the video game Montezuma's Revenge there are more variables in Esports titles than most of the simple games being played right now by deepmind Hearthstone could be the lowest hanging fruit and could be mastered in a year or two if focused on today giving you plug in all the cards abilities and run the scenario so that it can learn
a mobile game like League of Legends will take much longer there are so many variables that in order to run enough scenarios to effectively learn how to play and win we would need to figure out a different approach or wait until Quantum Computing comes to fruition and bada bing it would take a second to master not only any mobile esport but pretty much anything in the world so 5 months not five years later Deep Mind is already attacking its first Esports game because of that I will now adjust my estimate that deepmind will defeat top players in MOBA games like League of Legends from June 2021 to March 2019
