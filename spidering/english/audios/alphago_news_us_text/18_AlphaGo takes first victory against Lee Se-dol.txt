the first game of Paducah or go as it's known the rest of the world of the much-anticipated match of the century between human Grandmaster ESAT doing an artificial intelligence program alphago wrapped up after about 3 hours and three and a half hours that is and the result brace yourself for this machine beating Shuman but does this mean artificial intelligence outsmart humans each one has more
after 3 hours and a half the first round of the long-awaited go match between Grand Master Teresa doll and Google's alphago ended with a machine being declared the winner as Isabelle saw that the game could no longer be returned to his favor he did not make a hundred 87th move and 4 feet it instead the game with the type competition from the beginning and also go even made a number of moves that professional go players would not normally make but a critical mistake by he says Oh Long 227th move turn the tables for the machine
I think the mistake I made earlier led to my defeat even when I made the mistake I didn't think I was going to lose the game so today's game was a big surprise for me I didn't expect alphago to play this well but it wasn't an easy game for the machine either watching the stats of what alphago was doing and how it was priceless in the positions and it was stretched to his limits all the way through the game in times of every component about the go they push to its maximum using its value networks is policy Network to search everything has to come together and was the first wrestling match each other for the opportunity and express their mutual respect for each other
she's respectful Lisa Dahl and his amazing skills his famous for fighting and creative style and I think that made this game extremely exciting and very tense so very very excited about this historic moment and you know we're very pleased with our how alpha code on purple
but it might be too early to say that artificial intelligence has outsmarted human intelligence as they still have four more games to play giving us all the more reason to wait for Thursday's winner you doing I did on the news
