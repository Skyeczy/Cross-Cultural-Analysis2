AlphaGoâ€™s first formal match was against the reigning 3-times European Champion, Mr Fan Hui, in October 2015. Its 5-0 win was the first ever against a Go professional, and the results were published in full technical detail in the international journal, Nature. AlphaGo then went on to compete against legendary player Mr Lee Sedol, winner of 18 world titles and widely considered to be the greatest player of the past decade.
