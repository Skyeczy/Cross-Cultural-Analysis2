Artificial intelligence program "AlphaGo" has defeated the worldâ€™s top weiqi (Go) player Ke Jie, after beating the 19-year-old in two games of a three-part match. After the games on Tuesday and Thursday, the scoreline is 2-0. Despite the two losses, Ke has a chance to redeem himself in the third game on Saturday and win back some pride. Even though AlphaGo has beaten Ke, AI is, after all, the product of human ingenuity and imagination. It's developed, designed and controlled under the guidance of humans. So no matter who wins, it is indubitably an advance in human innovation. How can humans adapt in a world where robots can outperform us in so many areas? We turn to our panel to find out: Andy Mok, founder and president of Red Pagoda Resources; Bart Selman, professor of computer science at Cornell University and fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, and Chris Garlock, managing editor of American Go E-Journal, and a member of the American Go Association.Subscribe to us on YouTube: https://goo.gl/lP12gAWatch CGTN Live: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2-Aq...Download our APP on Apple Store (iOS): https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cctvn...Download our APP on Google Play (Android): https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...Follow us on:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ChinaGlobalT...Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/cgtn/?hl=zh-cnTwitter: https://twitter.com/CGTNOfficialPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/CGTNOfficial/Tumblr: http://cctvnews.tumblr.com/Weibo: http://weibo.com/cctvnewsbeijing
