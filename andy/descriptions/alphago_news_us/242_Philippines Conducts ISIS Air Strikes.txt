(CNN)The Philippines military is conducting air strikes as it fights to regain full control of Marawi, a city on the southern island of Mindanao that was overrun by ISIS affiliated fighters last week. More than a hundred people have died and 70,000 have fled the town of 200,000 since fighters from the Maute Islamist militant group entered the city, and clashed with military and police. "Precision airstrikes are (being) judiciously used to prevent collateral damage and employed at specific targets of resistance to protect our troops and hasten clearing of the city of terrorist elements who continue to resist," military spokesman Brigadier General Restituto Padilla said Tuesday according to the official Philippine News Agency.http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/30/asia/ph...http://www.wochit.comThis video was produced by YT Wochit News using http://wochit.com
