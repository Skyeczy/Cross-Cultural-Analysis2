This is the moment a thief is rumbled taking a cell phone from a cyclist in southwest China’s Sichuan Province. As seen in footage filmed by a passing motorcyclist, the man returns the phone to the owner before escaping from the scene, after the motorcyclist shouts the Chinese equivalent of “Stop, thief!” The motorcyclist then begins chasing the escaping suspect and his companion on board a motorcycle. The video was provided to AP, which reported that the incident took place on May 17, without saying where in Sichuan it happened.Subscribe to us on YouTube: https://goo.gl/lP12gAWatch CGTN Live: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2-Aq...Download our APP on Apple Store (iOS): https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cctvn...Download our APP on Google Play (Android): https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...Follow us on:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ChinaGlobalT...Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/cgtn/?hl=zh-cnTwitter: https://twitter.com/CGTNOfficialPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/CGTNOfficial/Tumblr: http://cctvnews.tumblr.com/Weibo: http://weibo.com/cctvnewsbeijing
