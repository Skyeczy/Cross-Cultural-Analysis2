Chinese Go player Ke Jie, the current world No. 1, admitted defeat during his second duel against computer program AlphaGo in east China's Zhejiang Province on Thursday. Having lost the first round of the best-of-three contest on Tuesday by the narrowest of margins, Ke came close and had his chances to beat AlphaGo during Thursday's match, held in the scenic Wuzhen Town. The player said he made "a few regretful moves" during the match which ultimately cost him the win. Demis Hassabis, the founder of DeepMind Technology, praised Ke on social media, describing the 19-year-old as "playing perfectly" early on in the contest. He later hailed the match between man and machine as "amazing and complex", saying that Ke "pushed AlphaGo right to the limit." The third and final face off between Ke Jie and AlphaGo will take place in Wuzhen Town on Saturday.http://www.cctvplus.com/news/20170526...Subscribe us on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/CCTVPlusCCTV+ official website: http://www.cctvplus.com/LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/cctv...Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewsContent....Twitter: https://twitter.com/CCTV_Plus
