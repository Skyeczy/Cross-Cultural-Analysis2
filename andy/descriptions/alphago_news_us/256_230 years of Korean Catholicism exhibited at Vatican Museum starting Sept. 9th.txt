한국 천주교회 특별전, 바티칸에서 9일 개최... 230년의 역사를 전하다  Roman Catholicism began to take root in Korea in the late 17-hudreds... and today it has grown to become one of the biggest religions in the nation.A major Christian pilgrimage this weekend is set to provide the world a glimpse of the tumultuous journey before the religion became widely accepted in Korea. Lee Ji-won introduces to us that special event.(Standup)   "Near the Cheonggyecheon stream which flows right through central Seoul is this commemorative plaque, marking the establishment of the first Roman Catholic community in Korea." This is where the first baptism in Korea took place in 1784.And the 230-year history of Korean Catholicism will be laid out in a special exhibition in the Vatican City starting Saturday.  For the first time, some 200 artifacts, chronicling the history of Roman Catholicism in Korea, will be displayed at the Braccio di Carlo Magno Hall in the Vatican Museums for two months.The relics include books, documents and paintings that show how, despite the severe martyrdom and persecution, Korea is the only country in the world where Catholicism has taken root without formal missionaries.One of the items on display is 'Cheon ju shil yi,' a doctrine written by Italian priest Matteo Ricci in Chinese to spread the word of God in East Asia. 'Chu-gyo yo-ji', or 'Essentials of the Lord's Teaching,' written by Jeong Yak-jong,... is another book on display,... that helped spread the religion in Korea.     The event was organized by the Diocese of Seoul who hope to show how the religion came about in Korea. Roman Catholicism was heavily oppressed by the authorities when it was first introduced in Korea, as the religion contradicted the country's Confucian and traditional values. The worship of God was seen as a direct challenge to the authority of the king, and Catholicism's ban on Confucian mourning rituals was seen as an undutiful act against the ancestors. And while society at the time had been divided into social classes, Catholicism taught people that everyone is equal under God.     Martyrdom and persecution continued for some 100 years starting with a massacre of Catholics in 1801. An estimated 10-thousand Catholics were killed in total. Documents showing such hardships will also be displayed at the exhibition,... including records of the captured martyrs' testimonies, and the torment and punishments they had to go through. The exhibition will also showcase rare works including Korean independence activist Ahn Jung-geun's calligraphy "Worship of Heaven,"... and works from the Vatican Museums,... including "The Silk Letter of Hwang Sayong," in which the Korean martyr asks the Bishop of Beijing for help.     The exhibition will begin by Cardinal Yeom Soo-jung giving mass at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City,... where the city state authorities, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon and other Catholic representatives will be present,... along with choirs from Korea, who will sing hymns throughout the ritual. (Korean)     "Our choir consists of children from various cultures, races and religions,... we hope our voice will touch the hearts of those in the Vatican and invite them to the exhibition."     The opening day of the exhibition falls on the same day that Pope Gregory (the sixteenth) XVI established a Korean diocese under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church in 1831, placing more meaning in an event that aims at promoting Korea's history and legacy of Catholicism to the world.Lee Ji-won, Arirang News.
