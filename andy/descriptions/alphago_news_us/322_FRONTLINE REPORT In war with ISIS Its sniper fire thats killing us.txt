After warning his commanders that the war against ISIS had become one of sniper fire, Lieutenant Colonel Firaz, deputy commander of Brigade 36, was killed by an ISIS sniper. “It’s all become sniper fire, which is killing us,” one soldier said. Dodging the sniper fire, Iraqi forces slowly inspect houses as they move forward. They found a weapons factory next door to a mosque and two doors down from peoples’ homes. The forces are trying to open a safe route for civilians fleeing the fighting and ISIS control. One young boy was wounded in a mortar attack three months ago. He still has shrapnel in his back.
