Since my PC upgrade I'm getting very cool sniper moments. This is a compilation with my best moments these last months! The name is inspired from the headshot callout in the Heavy damage voice pack that I hear very often, the sound is originally from Starcraft.Love these one shot kills, it's a very addictive playstyle but there is few moments where it's effective.Official website: https://fpsmoukass.com/Audio Extracts:AlphaGo the MovieOne man Tank turrets by LindybeigeThe 67 Steps by Tai LopezHouse of Cards s02Saving Private Ryan___________MUSIC_____________Music 1: Crysis 2 OSTLink: https://youtu.be/KcvndQIfu0AMusic 2: Adrenaline by Denis SurovLink: https://www.positionmusic.com/Music 3: Beyond by Joachim HeinrichLink: https://www.youtube.com/user/JoachimX...________________________________________---------------------------------------------------------------------------Want to join my outfit?
