"I am surprised at my own unwillingness to play the moves that I am seeing in the self-played AlphaGo games," says Redmond in this review with Chris Garlock, Managing Editor of the American Go E-Journal. "I believe that my intense study of AlphaGo has sharpened my reading skills and improved my positional judgement in the middle game."Produced by Michael Wanek.
