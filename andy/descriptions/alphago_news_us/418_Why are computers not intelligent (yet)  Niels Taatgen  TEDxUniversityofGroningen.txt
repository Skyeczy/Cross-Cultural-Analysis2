Niels Taatgen sheds light on both human and computer learning. Throughout his Talk, Niels Taatgen will show that there are fundamental differences between human and current machine intelligence, and will discuss how a different approach to machine intelligence can bridge the gap.Niels Taatgen investigates human behavior using computer simulations in order to understand our behavior in certain situations, for example when multitasking. He studied Computer Sciences and Psychology at the University of Groningen and gained his PhD in 1999 with a thesis titled "Learning without limits". He subsequently became a lecturer in the department of Cognitive Sciences, later known as Artificial Intelligence, at the University of Groningen. After a period in which he worked for both the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh (US) and the University of Groningen, he became a professor in Cognitive Modelling at the University of Groningen. He is currently the mastermind of the degree programme Artificial Intelligence.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
