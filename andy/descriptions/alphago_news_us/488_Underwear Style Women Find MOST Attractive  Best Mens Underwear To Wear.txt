In this video men's style, grooming, fitness and lifestyle expert, Aaron Marino of http://www.IAmAlphaM.com , http://www.AaronMarino.com , and http://www.peteandpedro.com covers different styles of men's underwear and which type women find most attractive.Alpha introduces an online underwear company. MeUndies features ridiculously comfortable, affordable, and quality underwear in 30 color and pattern combinations. MeUndies is offering viewers 20% off with ALPHAUNDIES!Men's Underwear Styles | Pros and Cons1. The Boxer Short - they are incredibly loose with zero constriction. The downside is that they offer no support and have a lot of extra fabric. When you have them on around the house, they are super comfortable. But when you are getting dressed, that's when things fall apart. Alpha describes. Note that a good boxer short has a button.2. The Brief - they aren't your Daddy's tighty whities. They fit snuggly and offer more support. They make your package and butt look amazing.3. The Boxer Brief (boxer + brief) - you don't have a lot of loose fabric, but the fabric can ride up causing a bit of required adjustment.4. The Trunk (boxer brief + brief) - Alpha's go-to option. They're not super long. They are comfortable and supportive without riding. For some dudes, the trunk is a bit too short. What do women find most attractive? Drumroll please-- the boxer brief! What do you as a man like? What style do you rock?
