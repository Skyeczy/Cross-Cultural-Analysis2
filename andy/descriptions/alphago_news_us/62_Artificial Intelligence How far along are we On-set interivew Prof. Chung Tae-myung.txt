인공지능 어디까지 왔나? 인공지능과 인간의 미래: 대담 성균관대 정대명 교수What we saw over the past week and the final game between AlphaGo and Lee Sedol is a big deal for humanity with lots of implications that stretch far beyond a board game. The final match between the first official match of man versus. machine may be over but, the bigger contest is by no means over.In the studio with me to provide us some perspective is Chung Tae-myung. Professor Chung is head of software department at Sungkyunkwan University. Professor Chung, welcome to the program. You watched the match between AlphaGo and Lee Sedol, I'm sure. First of all, before we get into anything, I'd like to know your overall thoughts. So, what you are saying is that it is actually deep learning that's involved here. Not just a computer program behaving based on a set of massive data. It's actually the machine LEARNING the way humans think. Is the ultimate goal of AI to mimic the human brain?Can we build robots A.I. machines with emotion? Sense of identiy... Can we go that far? We know Google's obviously been investing a whole lot in the field of AI for years now, Apple is on it, China's Baidu... essentially, major players have been looking into this sector for a while. How far along is Korea in this sector?Chung Tae-myung, professor of software at Seoul-based Sungkyunkwan University... thank you indeed for speaking with us tonight.Visit ‘Arirang News’ Official PagesFacebook(NEWS): http://www.facebook.com/newsarirangHomepage: http://www.arirang.comFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/arirangtvTwitter: http://twitter.com/arirangworldInstagram: http://instagram.com/arirangworld
