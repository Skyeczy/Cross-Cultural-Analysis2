Secretary of Defence for Intelligence (SDI), Kari Bingen warned that China and Russia are making huge advances in AI development while the US is lacking behind. She claims that the US has rapidly fallen behind in AI development and must now decide if it wants to “lead the coming revolution, or fall victim to it.” Robert Work, former deputy of SDI said the Pentagon needed to pour billions into developing advanced computing and robotics, or risk Russia developing killer robots that would “rule the world”. US billionaire Eric Schmidt backed the calls for action claiming that if the US failed to act soon, China’s technology would overtake Washington in five years.If you like this video, please share it and don't forget to subscribe!
