South Korean Go grandmaster Lee Se-Dol said Tuesday he was feeling less confident about his looming showdown with a Google-developed supercomputer and he would not underestimate the enemy. On Wednesday afternoon in the South Korean capital Seoul, Lee Se-Dol, the 33-year-old master of the ancient Asian board game Go, sit down to defend humanity. On the other side of the table was his opponent: Alphago, a programme built by Google subsidiary DeepMind. Lee said last month he would beat the computer by 5-0, or 4-1 at worst. But on Tuesday's press conference, he said it was not easy to make his prediction come true. He said briefings on the computer's functions had made him realize that it could operate "far more efficiently" than he initially believed. "I thought robots were not able to catch up human brains, especially in the capabilities like judgment and reasoning, so I was confident in myself. But after I have listened today's introduction, I feel that the machine can follow some of the capabilities of judgment and reasoning. So the match result may not like what I have predicted. I should be nervous as I may not win completely," Lee said. Demis Hassabisï¼Œco-founder and CEO of Google DeepMind, said although they were confident about the Alphago, they would try to find out some problems of the Alphago from this challenge match. "The problem is necessary, why we want to have this match is we need to see if there's any weaknesses we don't know about. So of course, we've tried to fix weakness that we know. But there may be something that our systems don't do, that brilliant players like Lee Se-Dol can create," he said. Lee added that artificial intelligence would ultimately defeat humans in Go, but robots would never understand the beauty of the game the same way that humans do. "Of course, I may lose the match, but I think the robots are not playing Go under the understanding of the beauty of the game. So the charm of the Go will go on. But this time, I will work hard to maintain the human dignity," he said.More on: http://cctvplus.tv/NewJsp/news.jsp?fi...Subscribe us on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmv5...CCTV+ official website: http://newscontent.cctv.com/LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/cctv...Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/CCTV/7...Twitter: https://twitter.com/NewsContentPLUS
