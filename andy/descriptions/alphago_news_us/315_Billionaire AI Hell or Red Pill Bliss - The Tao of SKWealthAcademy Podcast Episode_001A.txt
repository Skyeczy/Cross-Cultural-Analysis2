In today's episode, I discuss the Silicon Valley transhumanism movement to establish a new religion based upon an AI god, as well as the growing necessity to live outside the matrix of false paradigms and societal constructs engineered by billionaires in which 1. schools focus more on behavioral conditioning than education, 2. intellect has been stripped completely of emotional IQ, humanitarianism, and compassion, 3. social media apps promote anti-social behavior and soaring anxiety and depression rates among teenagers and 4. "success" relates only to material wealth with no regard for the negative consequences monetary gain may have upon a community and humanity in general. To be normal in a sick society is to become sick oneself. Therefore to live in harmony with nature and others, and to build a beautiful life for ourselves and others, we must choose an abnormal life outside of the normal paths taken by 99% of others.Show Notes:Subscribe to the Tao of SKWealthAcademy Podcast athttp://thetaoofskwealthacademypodcast...Follow us on Snapchat, and Twitter: skwealthacademyFollow us on IG: john_skwealthacademyIf you enjoyed this podcast, please consider donating to our patreon account athttp://www.patreon.com/skwealthacademyTo download this episode and follow our podcast on iTunes, click this link: https://itunes.apple.com/th/podcast/t...Intro/Outro music provided by creative commons, license free track: Hiphop instrumental vol 4 by Mr. AurimusReferenced information in current episodeAI godhead creation Way of the FutureWayofthefuture.churchTo request Dscouts smartphone usage study, click the link belowhttps://pages.dscout.com/mobile-touch...Family Guy episode with the “I’ve escaped from Kevin Spacey’s basement” referencehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xYpx...Seth McFarlane’s Oscar speech leak about Harvey Weinstein’s well-known sexual harrassment and assault behaviorhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCNvR...Henry Kissinger quote calling US soldiers “dumb, stupid animals” to be used as “pawns”https://www.quora.com/Did-Henry-Kissi...
