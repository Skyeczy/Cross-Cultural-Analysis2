SpaceX CEO Elon Musk congratulated Google’s AlphaGo after the AI shocked the world by defeating Go legend Lee Se-dol yesterday. The AI program, developed by Google's DeepMind unit, has just won the second game of a five-game Go match. Musk tweeted, “Congrats to DeepMind! Many experts in the field thought AI was 10 years away from achieving this.” Lee would need to win the three remaining games, whereas AlphaGo could wrap up the series in one win by Saturday.
