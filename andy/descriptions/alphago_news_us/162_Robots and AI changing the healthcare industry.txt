4차산업혁명,  의료의 새 흐름  Big data, Internet of Things, and Artificial Inteligence.The reach of the fourth industrial revolution can be felt in almost every industry.Its impact can also be clearly felt in the health sector.Our Kim Hyesung zooms in on the wind of change brought on by these technologies. 72 year old Hwang Ki-hyun is visiting the doctor to see how the surgery went. Just a week ago, Hwang got artificial joint replacements in both legs.(Korean)   "The arthritis got worse until it reached the point where I could hardly walk. I came here because I heard it did robotic surgery." This surgical robot enables surgeons to do knee or hip replacements using 3D computer imaging based on a CT scan, making the robot remove the areas of bone as mapped out by the surgeons.(Korean)     “The biggest advantage of the robotic surgery is precision. It has a less than 0.5 mm margin of error in surgery operations, compared with a surgeon's five mm. Optimal implant size and positioning means less pain, a faster recovery and a better outcome for patients." Since the robot was first developed in the late 1990s, the latest version has been passed by both the U.S. and Korea's food and drug safety ministries as of 2017, and is now being used in more than 13 hospitals in Korea.(standup)  "It’s not just robots that are supporting doctors. Artificial intelligence is also being used to analyze enormous amounts of data, diagnose illnesses, and provide a treatment plan for cancer patients." In this room, seven doctors are discussing treatment options for a uterine cancer patient.One of the 'doctors':... a supercomputer.This AI computer is loaded with 12 million cancer research papers and medical cases. It compares the data with the patient's genetic records. After a round of discussion, "surgery, then chemotherapy" is announced as the best treatment option. Since adopting Watson a year ago, the hospital has treated over 550 cancer patients with the supercomputer.(Korean)     "Through accumulating data and making corrections whenever the computer program gives a wrong answer, the decision concordance rate between AI and human doctors went up by around 7 percent over the past year, and satisfaction among patients is high." Multidisciplinary approach, with doctors from various departments working with AI, Instead of one-on-one doctor to patient treatment, is changing medical diagnostics. AI healthcare market alone is projected to reach six-point-six billion U.S. dollars by 2021, and expand into areas like preventive care. High costs and improving accuracy are still challenges for the robotics and AI industry, but what was once considered just hype is slowly becoming a new reality of healthcare.
