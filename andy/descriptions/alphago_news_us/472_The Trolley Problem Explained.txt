In 1967 Philippa Foot introduced us to the thought experiment called the Trolley Problem. This problem introduces a situation where a runaway trolley carrying four people is careening down the tracks towards a dead end. The four people in the trolley will certainly be killed in nothing is done. There is an option to divert the runaway trolley and save the four people but in doing so you will kill one person that is in the path of the now diverted trolley. What do you do?In this clip a robot is introduced in to the equation. Can humans code A.I. that would make the right choice.?Original Program Date: June 4, 2016Watch the Full Program Here: https://youtu.be/nDQztSTMnd8Subscribe to our YouTube Channel for all the latest from WSF.Visit our Website: http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/Like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/worldscience...Follow us on twitter: https://twitter.com/WorldSciFest
