Examples of narrow AI include IBM's Deep Blue and Watson, Apple's Siri, Google Now, Microsoft Cortana and the Tesla Autonomous Driving Software. They are rule-based platforms.By contrast, general purpose AI includes platforms like AlphaGo and the program that recreated the Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC).  In both cases, they were given enormous amounts of data and were then allowed to create their own rules. And in both cases, once complete, the researchers who created the software could no longer understand what the computer was doing.Patrick Schwerdtfeger is a leading authority on technology trends including big data, machine learning and the social media revolution. He regularly covers these topics at business conferences and conventions all around the world. Please contact us to check availability for your upcoming event.
