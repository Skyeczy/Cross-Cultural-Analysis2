이세돌 vs 알파고, 오늘 첫 대결The wait is almost over.In less than an hour from now, man will face off against machine in an epic game of Baduk, or Go.The competitors are... grandmaster Lee Se-dol of Korea versus artificial intelligence super computer Alpha Go.The first game of the five-game tournament will start at 1 p.m., local time, here in Seoul.For an update, we now connect live to Lee Ji-won, who's at the Four Seasons hotel, where the game will be held.Ji-won, lot of people in Korea and around the world have been eagerly anticipating this match up for months... the atmosphere there must be fantastic...Hi Mark. Everyone here is very excited for the match of the century, and you can feel the tension in the air as the competitors get ready to face off.Journalists from Asia and around the world -- about 350 members of the press -- are here to see if artificial intelligence can really beat human intelligence.No one will be allowed into the playing area during the game, but it will be broadcast on TV throughout Asia on Korea's Baduk TV and it will be live streamed on YouTube.Yeah,... the YouTube channel is DeepMind But, Ji-won, not many people, myself included, are that familiar with Go,... can you give us a brief run down of how the game works...Well, Mark, first, let me tell you briefly about the game of Baduk, or Go, as its known in the rest of the world.The goal is to surround the opponent's stones or, house, as they call it, and gain as much territory as possible.The surrounded stones are then taken off the board.Now, during today's match, each player will have 2-hours to make their moves.If a player uses up that time, he will then get an extra minute for each move.If the player goes over the one-minute limit three times, he loses automatically.So the game should finish sometime between 5 and 6 p.m. at the latest. Also, because AlphaGo can't physically move the game pieces, one of the developers, who is also a professional Go player, will act in its place to place the stones and input data. After every match, the players and developers will give a press conference to talk about how the game went from their perspective.That's all I have for now, but I'll be back with an update on the winner in our next newscast.
