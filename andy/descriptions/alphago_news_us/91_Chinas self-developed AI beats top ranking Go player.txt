The battle between human and artificial intelligence is not over. But in a bittersweet defeat, the world's second-ranked Go player Ke Jie lost out to a 'Made-in-China' AI. The competition began with the Chinese AI, Golaxy, taking the black on the board. Both seemed to be of equal strength at the beginning, but Golaxy began to show its advantage in the 46th hand. It ended the game at the 145th hand. After his loss to Google's AlphaGo, Ke said he's been studying how AI programs are playing the game. Golaxy is similar to AlphaGo, but it is said to have made breakthroughs in the model and algorithm structure that exceed the Google program.Subscribe to us on YouTube: https://goo.gl/lP12gADownload our APP on Apple Store (iOS): https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cctvn...Download our APP on Google Play (Android): https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...Follow us on:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ChinaGlobalT...Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/cgtn/?hl=zh-cnTwitter: https://twitter.com/CGTNOfficialPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/CGTNOfficial/Tumblr: http://cctvnews.tumblr.com/Weibo: http://weibo.com/cctvnewsbeijing
