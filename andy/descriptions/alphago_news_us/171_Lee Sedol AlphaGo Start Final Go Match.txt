South Korean Go master Lee Sedol and Google's Go-playing computer program AlphaGo on Tuesday started their fifth and final match of the ancient Chinese board game.The final match of the best-of-five series began at 13:00 local time at the Four Seasons hotel in Seoul.Lee, who has won 18 world championships during his 21-year professional career and is regarded as one of the greatest Go players of all time, picked up his first win of the series in the fourth match after three straight losses to AlphaGo, a computer program developed by Google's London-based artificial intelligence (AI) subsidiary DeepMind.Lee's victory indicates that AI has not yet completely surpassed humans in Go, which because of its complex, intuitive and creative nature has long been considered as the last game in which humans can beat machines.Playing black, Lee placed his first two stones on the more-territory oriented 3-4 points, while AlphaGo placed its first two white stones on the star points on the left side.After recording his first win on Sunday as white, Lee requested to play black in the final game, as he believes AlphaGo plays better with white and so the victory would be more significant.More on: http://cctvplus.tv/NewJsp/news.jsp?fi...Subscribe us on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmv5...CCTV+ official website: http://newscontent.cctv.com/LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/cctv...Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/CCTV/7...Twitter: https://twitter.com/NewsContentPLUS
