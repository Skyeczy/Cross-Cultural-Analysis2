바둑 배우기With all this commotion over the epic man versus machine game of Baduk, also known as Go, you may be wondering how this game is played.Our Oh Soo-young gives us an explanation of the rules so that you can try playing a quick round for yourself. It's all about marking your territory.Baduk, also known as Go, is an ancient game of strategy that originated in China around 3,000 years ago...It spread to Korea and Japan during the first century..., and still enjoys great popularity today with its centuries old rules remaining intact.The game is played by placing back and white stones by two players on an empty grid marked with lines... usually 19 by 19.And the player with the black stones always goes first.The stones are laid in turn on the intersections to form a "group", expanding a player's territory vertically or horizontally.Diagonal moves don't count.You get points by capturing your opponent's stones,... which you do by surrounding them with your own,... on the so-called "liberties" or vacant intersection points around the stones. Another way to gain points is by counting the number of vacant points inside your territory.Although the rules are simple, winning is never easy,... as the tactical possibilities of the game are practically endless.A session can last for hours, and it ends when neither player wishes to make another move.Points are added up at the end of the session, and extra points called "Dum" are bestowed to the player with white stones as a compensation for taking the second turn.Baduk is said to be a game that rewards virtues such as patience and balance, as it requires a high level of concentration and self-discipline.Oh Soo-young, Arirang News.
