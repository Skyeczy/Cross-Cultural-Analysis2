알파고, 68승 1패 후 은퇴 선언, 이세돌 유일한 승자Never underestimate the heart of a champion, even if it's a machine.The computer program AlphaGo made headlines one last time before retirement, beating Chinese master Ke Jie in a 3 match series sweep.The 19-year-old was brimming with confidence before the event in Wuzhen -- confident he wouldn't be trumped by a machine.In the final match, which lasted just 4 hours, he was in tears, calling the AI program developed by Google, perfect, flawless and emotionless.After 69 games, AlphaGo's sole defeat was handed to him by South Korea's Lee Se-dol.The amazing creation estimated the first 50 moves -- by both players -- almost flawlessly.A co-founder of the company behind AlphaGo, Demis Hassabis, plans to retire the program... and use AI to focus on solving problems human experts may not have considered.
