that was staying late now lost week the world's best player in the Chinese board game go was pretty soundly beaten by Google's artificial intelligence alphago for those following the rapid development of II it was it wasn't exactly a surprise 20 years ago however a victory of machine over man shocked the world from Singapore collectic warnings about a role in society in questions about whether Humanity could survive in a world where we could be outdoors by computer the man at the center of that much was chess Grandmaster Garry Kasparov the machine was IBM supercomputer deep blue you talk about the fact that it took you a long time to get over. Defeat in Chester can you explain one took a lot longer than she did get over and losing this match
I was a big shock I knew I made mistakes and I didn't play well and I could kick myself in my head so for not preparing for the match since then you could come and go at the end of the future of the sultan film Professor went negative something wrong will happen I'm going to tell you that they would positive we can avoid it but at least we have a chance to turn it into adventure and on since it's happening anyway and I quit seeing what's happened the game of chess I have been looking for for four ways and means to to make it make it apart and I believe that there's so many things we can do some people say that we don't know what's going to happen next fantastic that's exactly the reason for us to move there because we don't know that was one of the one of the main driving forces in history open on the alpha go software that's just won the match with every different way which is teaching itself the rules how do you feel about that kind of guy is that the way that
I should go to learn about the rules of the worlds one from say that the blue was innocent but intelligent it was intelligent as your alarm clock very very powerful brute force with little chest Knowledge Test proved to be vulnerable to be crunched that's roughly was the average speed of of the blue it's over little intelligence so it's inside in the mysteries of human intelligence
alphago is different because it's self teaching program and if we if we're looking for AI definition it still hurt you will understand what God is AI because now we moving from probably from science to philosophy that was to understand exactly what you want to tell you that you think of a grand challenges for artificial intelligence what other things that may be on being talked about enough for the people don't think about enough when it comes to accepting and implementing artificial intelligence think it's important that we do and we know how to do machines will do better eventually everything everything we do and we know how we do but there's so many things that we do know how we do and let's concentrate on that because machines have I'll be reduced and they are getting better and better machines
purpose and everything good thing is that we know we have purpose but we know we don't know exactly you know what the purpose is so that guarantees that will stay around for quite a while
