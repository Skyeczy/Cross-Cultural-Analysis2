snow glows white on the mountain tonight not a footprint to be seen
kingdom of isolation
looks like I'm the queen
the wind
Heaven Knows
Let It Go Let It Go never bothered me anyway
it's funny how some distance
no line
Let It Go
Let It Go Let It Go
I want to see Lori Sue they haven't you
Florida spiraling in frozen fractals
Saint Christopher
the cold never bothered me anyway
