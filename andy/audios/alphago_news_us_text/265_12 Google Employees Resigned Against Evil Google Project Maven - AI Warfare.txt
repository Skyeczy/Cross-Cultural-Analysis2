rolling his project has been to create artificial intelligence to do image classification on the footage collected by drones and so they were trying to help the Department of Defense Mark objects in his footage to say this car is a car this building is a building this is a person employees at Google had a problem with this how did they protest it what was their concern
so there's a couple of different concerns within the employees some employees at Google feel like the company shouldn't be involved with the military at all their other employees at feel that using artificial intelligence in this context is particularly risky they first see a future where eventually you have a computer making the decision of whether or not to carry out a drone strike and they feel like a human should be the one who's making a decision not a computer and so there's been a few things that they've done to push back and protest there was an open letter that they sent her on the company asking Google to cancel the contract and obviously they've been speaking to the Press about some of their objections as well
have Google Executives been thinking about this and that you have obtained some emails what was the chatter among the kind of the c-suite so it was really interesting when they were his project there's a lot of conversation about the concern of how the public would perceive this and it particularly in the use of AI in military context there was a lot of conversation back and forth of you know how are we going to shape public perception about this how is this going to reflect on our image but there wasn't as much of the conversation about the actual ethics of this kind of decision and that ethical conversation is the one that employees have really been pushing for and how big of a part of Google's revenue or how significant a line of business is this the Google
so the maven contract itself is not particularly significant for Google I believe the earliest number that they had was round 15 million and 4 Google that's not very much money at all but the idea was that this would sort of your foot in the door for them with future military contracts and could put them into the running for much much larger contract down the road and do this will other or are other companies lobbying for these contracts major Cloud providers and it's entirely like that one of those other companies will step up and feel Google shoes once their contract expires in 2019 decided that they're not going to renew this in 2019 meaning they are still continuing to work on this project are there Ripple effects going forward for some of the employees that are still concerned and inside Google today
from the beginning that they want the contract to be canceled and it's not what has happened so far Google is saying that they're going to finish out the contract and so I expected employees probably will continue to push back on Google's involved in this is there a larger conversation that's happening among tech companies about how they should be working with or not working with the US government I think so there's been a lot of Reckoning throughout the industry over the last year so we're employees are kind of wondering about how the products that they create or being used you know you see this at Facebook in the wake of the Cambridge analytica Scandal I think you see this with Twitter a little bit and some of the trolling and harassment that's gone on there and of course with Google in this that you know in this military contractors a lot of questioning about you know what are we creating here is it fundamentally going to be used for good or is it not
