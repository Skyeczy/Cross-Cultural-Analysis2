the old project started investment the best part of two years and the second which is shale has really seen a new life being breathed into it as of last year kind of middle of the year when OPEC started to say okay we're going to jump back in and manage the market again once had to control prices and their prices are likely to remain low for some time to come don't hurt cgtn New York
