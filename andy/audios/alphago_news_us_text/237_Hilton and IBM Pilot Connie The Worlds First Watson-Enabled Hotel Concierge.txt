since their emotions since their level of urgency to be able to take Robotics and artificial intelligence introduced it to the hotel business as a way of helping us operate more efficiently helping us to Delight or customers it's big dream what excites me about this partnership is the courage of Hilton to try something you the courage of way Blazer to build on the technology so that courage is going to push us to continue to advance Connie and that's also going to allow the humans who work in those hotels to go beyond that to help people even further by having Connie through the basic things
