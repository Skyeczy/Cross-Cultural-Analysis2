the government of the Philippines has inspection of North Korea free tour in one of the First Act mandated by new UN Security Council sanctions against Pyongyang Bruce Harrison is live in the studio with me for more on that inspection countries are on the world anytime any minute on the implementing those measures looks like this ship is 1 of 31 that was blacklisted under the new US sanctions and this is a sign that are the inspection because the inspection by there is a sign at least tell me when nations are all ready to fall through with these mandates which were approved unanimously and I means of course with the support of China still being held there but the Filipino Coast Guard did not find anything suspicious are they took some dogs trained to detect explosives on board and they search the ship and they check crew documents other Coast Guard said
and still being held is because the inspection revealed to several minor safety problems including issues with fire fighting and electrical equipment the Coast Guard said that the ship cannot leave for until those issues are fixed experts in the shipping industry told Reuters the owners of un blacklisted ships would have trouble getting the vessels insured refueled or even call at 4 and 4 it's when shipping or even told the news agencies that ships may be prevented from Trading to most places as a result but another lawyer is said the vessel may be able to continue some trade because it would be up to individual member countries to pass legislation to enforce those new UN sanctions
