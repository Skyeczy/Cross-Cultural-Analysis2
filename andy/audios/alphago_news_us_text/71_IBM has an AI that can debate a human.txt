allow me to respond to some of my opponents most recent claims I think that one of the claims made by Ms Evalia was that people should choose how to spend their money I would like to offer a different view people should spend their hard-earned money as they pleased as most people would not choose to support them subsidies are necessary another point that I believe my opponent made was it there are more important things in space exploration to spend money on for all of these reasons I think the motion should stand we should subsidize space exploration that concludes my speech thanks for listening I now invite nobody to her speech of rebuttal
