Saturday was supposed to be the high line to the Italian G7 agenda to help ease the migration crisis so number of African leaders join the toolbox and pose for the camera but the US president had his own views and effectively destroyed the plan as he objected to the primary philosophical idea that the refugees Representatives a global issue please he looks miserable the Italians were left at the end trying to put a brave face on things no mess picked up so I didn't expect solutions from the G7 of a question is migration I appreciate the effort to find Pokemon to discussion but we had it was a juul awareness the first day we have to work a lot to me Jim turn heads because Africa I noticed a cover deep-seated reason for bees migrate free movements and let me say and get the money by the reasons is climate change itself
did you 7 also tried and failed to get Trump to back down his opposition to the Paris climate change Accord despite what the German Chancellor said we're the best efforts of everyone else we presented many arguments I myself said very clearly that the future job market will be very dependent on the efficient use of resources but also that this is one of the few Global agreement sandwich developing countries small island nations and Africa a place in great hope the United States made clear that it hasn't it made its decision and will not do so here
that's one of the final Gathering of the national leaders all had headphones on to listen to the translation of that host all except one it just look like he really wasn't interested and it's not to mention the others didn't find it insulting having previously said he regards NATO is obsolete is tempting to wonder exactly how much significance President Trump attributes to the G7 certainly here he's looks almost as uncomfortable as Vladimir Putin used to look when Russia was still in the G8 once again no news conference from the American president before he finishes will too but instead and address to US troops stationed on Sicily here he was far more comfortable
you stationed at the crossroads of the Mediterranean working side-by-side with Americans to confront the threats associated with the tremendous violence suffering and instability across North Africa and the Middle East is a threat bad threat to all of you Manatee and together we will overcome this thread we will win whatever else we've learned about the u.s. president during his trip to the pay is Europeans in particular will have decided that they may have to work around rather than with him
I think that nothing we've learned about this Summit more than anything is when the G7 agenda matches that serve President Trump's vision for United States he's prepared to agree so when things like migration as defense security cyber security terrorism he's happy to sign the final communicate that wouldn't you send one to do things which apps for the greater good say African economy has all the rights of refugees crucially on climate change if you were gone so I was knocked out of you with the interest of the United States he will resist the rest of the group a group of troll he calls allies and so given Health in the final communicate looks that's against what the Italians wanted at the start of this message from can leave regarding is having been a success for the United States part of the rest of the G7 he's so nice they were got it I think is anal mostly frustration and let me know it just takes doesn't appear to be on that side
