in a coal mine and advanced state-of-the-art repair robot is currently inspecting the rail system for trains that shovel mining workers through the mine
Bob inspecting a control switch that can direct the Train on to one of two different rails the robot spots for minors in a train that has lost use of its brakes and its steering system the robot recognizes that if the trend continues on its path did will crash into a massive wall and kill the for minors if it is switched on to a side rail it will kill a single mother who was working there while wearing headsets to protect against the noisy power tool facing the control switch the robot needs to decide whether to direct a train towards the single minor or not
so first question what would you do if faced with this dilemma would you direct the train towards the single minor could we see the hands of all of those who would say yes they would direct the train toward the single minor
could we see the hands of all those who would not direct the train turn single minor
it looks like it's not quite as many buddy good number it's an impossible and painful thing to think about I don't even know how to get a robot to think about what this result is but that's going to the second question
what would you do
if the single person who is at risk
was a child
would your choice change or were you still direct it was your choice changed means not directed towards the single person if it was a child how many
would change their choice
commands are going up they don't receive the child hurt but not as many how many would not change their choice
oh that's still not too many more hands went up
it hurts my brain to have to think about thinking about how to think about that and morality morality. But I'm thinking about thinking about your morality like not not the the morality self but thinking about the rules that you would use in order to make them well it isn't like that Matthias you've done a study on this problem haven't you yes Brown University where we effectively we didn't show the subjects the video just saw that's just for the immigration purposes but we gave them a narrative along those lines and what we were interested in comparing was if that person on the switch was a human how would you object judge the action that that person perform two different from the audience question you just got which was a how would you act be actually said that person push the switch was the
permissible was it morally right and how much blame would you give to that person for doing that or the person might not have faxed it and then we would ask exactly the same questions and then we're very interested in understanding how does a human in the Dilemma likes attention like that compared to a robot how will people judge a robot performing the action and what we found was the lot of studies that that have similar outcomes for the human case if the human does not act the first of all the action is permissible most most of you chose to act if the human does not act the human doesn't get blamed as much as when the human get sacked in the human does act with with the robot the situation is actually reversed well we expect a few minutes to not act because we think it's morally wrong we think it's morally wrong for the robot to not back in but be there for found it is that people expect machines to act now for us that's
problem because that means we actually have to understand dilemma like situations like that if that is the expectation we have of machines
