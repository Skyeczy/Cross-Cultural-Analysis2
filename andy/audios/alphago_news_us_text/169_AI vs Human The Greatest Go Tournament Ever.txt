preventive artificial intelligence the past few weeks have been very exciting last October for the first time ever an AI built by Google known as alphago beat a professional human player at the incredibly complex board game go then in this last week it went on to be one of the best go players in the world 4 times which is a really big deal and let us explain to you why when Engineers talk about artificial intelligence they don't mean sentient humanoid robots conversing with us talking to us becoming feeling the taking over the world destroying us if programming computers to do things that humans normally have instructions to complete tasks so they struggle with situations that have lots of options and require decision-making on the Fly and putting playing complicated board games like go by capturing the other players pieces or by climbing areas of the board with black or white stones have been part of the winning strategy for any game of the ability to think a few moves ahead taking into account what the other player might duy
time you make a move we humans can use our past experiences with the game to figure out the best moves and how our opponents might respond to them but it's hard to build that kind of pattern recognition into a computer program so generally computer play board games like Chess By searching through all of the possible combinations of mousse to find the one that means it's most likely to win the problem is go is played on a huge 19 by 19 grid and there are hundreds of possible moves that a player might make in every turn in fact there are more ways for a game of Go to play out then there are atoms in the universe so if it's that difficult to program an AI to beat humans it go how did Engineers teach alphago to do it well instead of having the AI sort through all possible combinations of moves they tried to help it understand the difference between a good move and a bad one to do that the engineers First Fed alphago 30 million combinations of moves taken from real games with expert human players then alphago played thousands of matches against itself to learn new
strategies all that knowledge plus some cover programming helps the day I decide on the next 7-Day consider every single possible move which would take a really long time I can quickly narrow down the fuel most relevant options and so far this strategy has worked really well against us humans a few months ago alphago played a five-match tournament against fawnway the European go champion and one every single game the first time a computer had ever won against the professional golf player at all it was time to test the AI against a South Korean who's been the top go player in the world for the past decade they live stream to all five matches and uploaded 15 minutes summaries which are all Linked In the description below and spoiler alert alphago won the first three so best out of three or five won the tournament so it was pretty clear that the way the engineers programmed and train the way I did work now. Going to Delaware still set to play the last two games in the series and still actually won the fourth game which is a huge deal because it showed that the AI still isn't perfect 2 choosing the best moves
main point in this game would win so don't play dumb move known as a wedge one that has lots of possible responses basically he was trying to confuse the AI by giving it too many options to explore and that's even after all that training the way to the game went downhill for alphago until it's internally calculated chances of winning went below 20% at which point it's programmed it to resign turned out to be a very close game with alphago making a mistake early on but eventually winning so I might not be the best go player in the world right now but it'll just keep getting better from here so I'm sorry eventually it will be either way it's a huge step forward for our thank you for watching this episode of Sideshow news and thank you especially to all of our patrons on patreon who make this all possible thank you so much for being a patriot if you are if you want to become one of those people you can go to patreon.com there's a bunch of cool things you can get there as well and don't forget to go to youtube.com scishow and subscribe
