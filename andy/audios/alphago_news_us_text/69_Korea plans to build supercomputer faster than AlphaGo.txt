North Korea wants to develop a super computer that can process information of to five times faster than alphago Google's AI system that Bikram us that you said dough in a 5-game series about it or has it snowed internationally go on Chris very ambitious goal going generic reports
South Korea science Ministry announced on Monday that over the next 10 years they'll be investing almost 90 million dollars to develop super computers that compete with a well delete the ministry aims to come what is the speed of the Year 2020 developing a computer that has a processing speed of 1 petaflop does a quadrillion operations per second to put that into contacts the average lap time currently has less than 1 teraflop 1007 petaflop even the supercomputer behind alphago is there any police to run on 0.2 20.3 petaflops Curry has a lot of catching up to do the first petaflop supercomputer was built by MGM in 2008 I'm currently the fastest is China's 10 her to which can pluck / 33
prayers never built a petaflop supercomputer before a local scientist a confident that once they create one they will be able to develop a 30 part epoxy of computer within the next 10 years. 70 feasible if the government thinks long time on the funding keeps going for the full 10 years and we should be successful. How much commercial body but they can be important for a company or government to become key players in the technology field supercomputers help in the development of servers PCS in mobile device Technologies if it does not develop in invest in this kind of Technology it could cause difficulties for the country to compete globally in the long run
