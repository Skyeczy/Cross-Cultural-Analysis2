say anytime you're talking to your phone it's pretty much a neural net doing that it does really well on image recognition autonomous cars come in soon top-flight method for genetic sequence same is a neural network you can stay there Loosely inspired by the brain it is a network of neurons people calling her on and they're all connected to each other going down through the layers in a way they mimic neurons and that their little triggers its neuron has kind of a threshold called awaits where makes a decision so it takes in data use map images and then once the network is trained you can put one image in at the front they fire when they see the thing that they want to see so you had this kind of cascade moving for the neural network and that does really poorly he just as horribly but this is little magic trick called backpropagation and this is very unbiological your neurons don't do this at all but
the end you're like okay well you were wrong but here is a proper picture of a dog and now you send all that information back through the network again and the network learn so it's a little bit better how to say oh this is a dog elegant map and really the breakthroughs in the field were when they stop trying to be so biological in the 1980s at the time I didn't work that great but turned out all they needed was a huge amount of processing power and a huge amount of examples and they would really sing so in many of these cases accuracy is enough but when you're talking really life and death decisions driving and Tommy car Mickey medical diagnosis for pushing the frontiers of science to understand why a discovery was made you really need to know what the AI is thinking not just what is results are since you have all these layers in chest engages in such complex decision-making that it just is essentially a black box we don't really understand how they think all is not lost this black box problem people are actually trying to
all this now to a variety of different ways when researchers create a tool kit to get at the activation of individual neurons in a neural network the tool kit works by taking this individual neuron internet works to go back and find all the weights that really make that neuron just fire like crazy keep doing this thousands of times and you can see the kind of perfect input for this neuron then look inside these layers he could see that some neurons learn these really complex abstract ideas like a face detector someday I can detect any human face no matter what it looks like it's not a property would expect an individual neuron to have most don't but something may neural-net researchers think of it this way you can think of the decision-making of a neural net s kind of terrain of valleys and Peaks and the ball represents this piece of data so you can understand this one decision that was made in one Valley but all those other valleys
you have no idea what's going on
so one way to get at what in AI is thinking is to find a proxy for what its thinking so when Professor is taking the video game Frogger and trained an AI to play the game cuz that's fairly easy to do now but what was it decided to do it's really hard to know especially in this sequence tough decisions and dynamic environment of that so rather than trying to get the AI self to explain himself he asked people to play the video game and have them say what they were doing as they were playing it and before the state of the Frog the same time and then he found a way to use neural networks to translate those two languages the code of the game and what they were saying and then he importer that back to the game plan that works so then the network was armed with these human insights so you know as the frog is waiting for a car to go by and say oh I'm waiting for a hold open up before I go or if you get stuck on the side of the screen and it would say Jesus is really hard and curse
flashing human decision-making on to this network with more do networks it's all about trust if you have a result and you don't understand why I made that decision how can you really advance in a research you really need to know that there's not some spurious detail destroying things a lot larger and more complex and I don't think anyone thinks they'll get to a global understanding of what a neural network is thinking anytime soon but we can get a sliver of this understanding science can really push forward and these neural networks can really play
