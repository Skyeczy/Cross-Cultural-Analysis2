hey we're back Chris garlic and Michael Redmond Michael how you doing so much happening to go world lately it's a big fat zero as far as stuff goes right yeah well we have this big shock when zero came into the picture we were expecting any games that was a big big present you might say and I tell you I probably will have to be helping us with some of the technical aspects PS4 game system with a game set with the Lisa told person playing against the zero and
the master version playing against zero and then there's two others the 20 block on the 45 version of this 0 version games of tattoos of the training runs where they make these two person so my understanding is that was the one that played Master right and so I'm going to be looking at the list of games were Master plays zero mainly because Masters such a popular version about to go ride I'm at the end of 2016 and play 60 games against topcoats winning the mall it was playing like big summaries and the kids and emphasizing the center of the board a little bit more than human players to and all of this stuff is tactics the people wanted to play before
because they were that way of playing this week and territory and so you can answer to like to play that style we're having trouble making it work and so master so awesome ways to actually use that and some successful story was attached to that way of playing and it's still having an effect on how professionals play and so it should have been established as a part of our Professional Knowledge and primary
so that's why I want to start with that I will be doing so I will be doing a study of the openings because the openings there's a few there's a couple of openings that will be happening again and again in the stairs so we'll start out with that that'll be our next video we're going to be sort of getting getting a video about the openings and we're going to take a look at least one of these zero games and it was just sort of go from there how you made it popped back in and not pick up another master master game Pandora Master Zero game Social Service see how your insides take you and it will also be tracking people's comments and responses so you'll be sure to let us know so really interesting so I'll be going back to them to okay well you know I knew we had a bunch of games to go in the master series and now we've just got
