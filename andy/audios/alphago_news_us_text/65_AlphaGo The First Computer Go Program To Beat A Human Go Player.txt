go has been a challenging game because of what he mentioned the branching factor that is at any point when you can make it moved as lots and lots of choices that you have to make a subsequent move and traditional techniques in the eye that looks at the subject and take it you know moves and then at the move against them over at the movement for that move did not really work the the choices were too large and as you can see in this graphic the tree that is being built by looking at all the combinations is too large for different techniques to solve the problem right I've been around since the 80s frankly with some minor tweaks and what's Advanced has been frankly the hardware in the data and given that this thing that the technology to Hardware is Advanced it's allowed to implement these techniques and develop systems like this but am I surprised that I machine computer Humana go well no as you said the estate space of go the number of combinations of boards is huge and
that's what makes it hard for humans but machines are better at counting than humans so quantitative several years before people thought that it would happen but you have to remember if you're thinking about like are the robots going to take over now that in go you were lying on 36th world the rules are always the same you can play against yourself hundreds of millions of time is he can simulate things he got a lot of data and in the real world things are constantly changing and they're constantly changing him in perfect competition last year where robots had to do things like open doors and end drive cars and things like that and it was a YouTube video but you should all go home and look up at about bloopers from this until the robots were falling over some Ragtime music or something like that and it's hilarious and the important thing to remember when you watch this video relative to alphago is it everything that was done in this video was actually done in simulate
first they were robots in simulation were able to open the doors perfectly and then the real world you had started to have things like friction and and you in a little bit of things like that and then suddenly because things weren't exactly the same as in the simulation it didn't work that well anymore the techniques and alphago at least at this stage are not I think robots to go in from a simulation to a real world they were lying on the back you can get a lot of data in simulation and so that's a limit at least for now for how the system goes it might be a component in a larger systems someday but it's not like tomorrow we're going to see robots what we're actually going to see a robot today the robot that we are going to see today is not going to be able to take over the world it's nothing like that level of cognition just yet
