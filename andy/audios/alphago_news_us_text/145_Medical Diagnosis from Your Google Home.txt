Virtua tennis like Google home and Amazon's Alexa can perform simple tasks like turning on your lights when you're not home or even activating your security system with just the sound of your voice what if I told you people are not using these devices to diagnose why they aren't feeling well a large medical database is Now supported by Google home after we have in front of us and people are asking these devices essentially everything so we thought we would have a little bit of fun because apparently Millions upon Millions upon millions of us are using these devices so Ducks should we put it to the test yes

OK Google I have itchy nipples health conditions related to include Paget's disease of the breast breast cancer pregnancy
very rare itchy things on the differential differential and the most common things and disease while very much a possibility would not be the first thing I've learned out at somebody and I think that is it this cyberchondria is this medical anxiety related to things that are read or heard online and I think being aware that it's not an appropriate to use these devices it's inappropriate to use them the wrong way and I think if you're relying on this device as your doctor you're at you're in a lot of trouble online and the problem with that is that two-thirds of the time they incorrectly self-diagnose so now they're doing some homeopathic interventions that are useless or maybe even dangerous and they're not sick
the medical help they truly need for the disease they do have what's crazy is that it can hear your voice it can access information in your home is so in this is this gets weird I have I have a similar device in my home and I often think to myself if someone hacked in to the Wi-Fi they can probably listen to every single conversation
where would we go for in George Nichols
so just just be aware when you're using these devices and if you truly are concerned about a medical condition do go see a professional
