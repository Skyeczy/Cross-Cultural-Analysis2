find Define intelligence simply as how good something is at accomplishing complex goals and human intelligence today is very different from machine intelligence today in multiple ways first of all machine intelligence in the past used to be is that always inferior to human intelligence gradually machine intelligence better than human touches it certainly very very narrow areas like multiplying numbers fast like pocket calculator is a remembering large amounts of data really fast
what we're seeing now is that machine intelligence is spreading out the limit from those narrow Peaks and getting it broader
we still have nothing with this broad is is human intelligence you know where you meant child can learn to get pretty good at almost any goal but that you have systems now for example that can learn to play a whole swath of different kinds of computer games or to learn to drive a car and it is pretty varied environments and
with things are obviously going in the eye is increased breath and the Holy Grail of AI research is to build a machine that is as broad as human intelligence anything and once that's happened is very like he is not just going to be as bored as you but also better than humans at all that the tasks as opposed to do something right now I have to confess but I'm quite the computer nerd myself
I wrote some computer games back in high school and college and more recently I've been doing a lot of learning research with my lab at MIT
so it's something that really blew me away in like what was when when I first saw this Google deepmind system but learn to play computer games
from scratch you had this artificial simulated neural networks it didn't know what a computer game was it didn't know where the computer was it didn't know what a screen was you just fed in numbers that represent the different colors on the screen
and them
I will have to take it out put different numbers of Correspondence different keystrokes to also know anything about that and then kept the skating at the score and all this off my new was it's not a bad score
so you can say what am I watching this in the screen went with them until Saba's the CEO of Google deepmind show them and seeing the first time this thing really played total BS strategy and lost all the time it got better and better and then it got better than I was and then after awhile it figured out this crazy strategy and break out where you're supposed to bounce a ball off of a
brick wall
where it would keep aiming for the upper left corner until it punched a hole through there and got the ball bouncing around in the back distracted crazy many points and the guys to program this didn't even know about that strategy cuz they haven't played that game in very much this is a simple example of how machine intelligence can surpass much in the same way as a human child can end up becoming more intelligent than its parents if educated well
this is just a tiny little computers
certified where you can have on your desktop if you know imagine scaling up to the biggest computer facilities we have in the world and you give us
a couple of more Decades of algorithm development I think it's very plausible that we can make machines but cannot just learn to play computer games better than us but you better view life is a game and do everything better than us
